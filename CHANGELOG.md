## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Bumped `google.golang.org/grpc` from 1.82.1 to 1.83.1 (indirect, via the
  plugin framework's provider server). The 1.83.1 notes carry two xds/rbac
  fixes for DENY rules failing open on nested rules. `govulncheck` reports
  nothing reachable from this provider before or after the bump, so unlike
  the 1.82.1 bump that went out as v2.4.1, this one is routine hygiene and
  waits for the next release. Applied GitLab-side; the GitHub dependabot PR
  (#35) was closed with a pointer, since GitHub is a push mirror.

### Fixed

- `truenas_cloudsync_credential`'s `mapResponseToModel` always rewrote
  `provider_attributes_json` from the server's own echo of the credential
  (the same drift-suppression pattern `cloud_sync.go`/`cloud_backup.go` use
  for their own, non-sensitive `attributes_json`). TrueNAS masks sensitive
  fields in that echo - `acc_cloudsync_credential_test.go`'s own
  `ImportStateVerifyIgnore` rationale already says as much ("cloud-credential
  attributes contain S3/B2/etc secret keys masked on read") - so whenever the
  planned value for this field was already known (any apply after the
  upstream access-key/secret-key values it's built from already exist in
  state, i.e. every apply after the first), `terraform apply` failed
  outright with "Provider produced inconsistent result after apply:
  .provider_attributes_json: inconsistent values for sensitive attribute."
  An initial fix in this same PR marked the field `Optional`+`Computed`
  (matching `cloud_sync.attributes_json`'s already-correct shape) on the
  theory that Computed was the missing piece - that didn't hold up: Computed
  only changes behavior when a field is omitted from config entirely, and
  this one never is, so the planned value's known-ness (and thus whether the
  crash fires) never depended on the Required/Optional split. The actual
  fix is in `mapResponseToModel` itself: it no longer reconstructs
  `provider_attributes_json` from `cred.Provider` at all, so Create/Update
  leave it as exactly what was planned and Read/Import leave it as exactly
  what was already in state - the same "just don't touch it" pattern
  `user.go` uses for `password` and `iscsi_auth.go` uses for
  `secret`/`peersecret`. `provider_attributes_json` is back to `Required`
  (not `Optional`+`Computed`), since nothing about it is actually computed
  by the provider anymore - `Required` is now the accurate contract. The
  same `Required`-without-`Computed`-and-reconstructed-from-server shape
  exists on `reporting_exporter.go`'s `attributes_json` and
  `keychain_credential.go`'s `attributes` (both also documented as
  masked-on-read in the same ignore-list), left out of this fix to keep it
  scoped to the resource that was actually blocking.

- The `timeouts` block did nothing. All 68 resources declared one, and not a
  single CRUD method read it, so `timeouts { create = "45m" }` was accepted,
  stored in state, and ignored. Reported as
  [#34](https://github.com/PjSalty/terraform-provider-truenas/issues/34).

  268 CRUD methods now derive their context from the block. Four are exempt
  with a reason: they make no API call, so there is nothing to bound. Defaults
  are 20m create, 20m update, 20m delete and 5m read, and an unreadable value
  reports the problem and falls back rather than leaving the call unbounded.

  `TestResourcesHaveTimeoutsBlock` only ever checked that a resource DECLARED
  a block, which is presence rather than enforcement, and is why this survived.
  `TestResourcesConsumeTimeoutsBlock` now checks that each one reads it.

- The CRUD-discipline invariants were blind to 16 of the 272 CRUD methods.
  Their shared pattern required both `req` and `resp` to be named, so any
  method that discarded one with `_` was never matched by
  delete-handles-not-found, CRUD logging, or state persistence. Those methods
  were not exempt, they were unseen, which reads exactly like passing. Widening
  the pattern surfaced two singleton deletes that now carry an explicit
  exemption and rationale.

- Three resources carried a `Timeouts` field split across a stray comment
  (`Timeouts timeouts.` / comment / `Value`), a leftover from an earlier
  mechanical edit. It compiled, and it hid the field from anything matching on
  the type.


## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-28

**Breaking.** `truenas_system_update` renamed two attributes and removed a
third. `auto_download` is now `autocheck`, `train` is now `profile`, and
`available_status` is gone. The resource called five `update.*` methods that
do not exist in TrueNAS middleware, so every plan touching it failed before
reaching anything else; it is now built on `update.config` / `update.update`,
and TrueNAS 26.0 replaced release trains with update profiles. Existing state
migrates automatically, but a configuration naming `auto_download` or `train`
has to be updated or it fails with "Unsupported argument". Nothing else in
this release removes or renames an attribute: verified by diffing every
`Schema()` attribute name against v2.4.1.


### Added

- New `truenas_container_images` data source listing the images an LXC
  container can be created from, with every version the registry publishes for
  each.

  This exists because image versions are datestamped and the registry keeps
  only the most recent few, so a version hardcoded in a configuration stops
  resolving within days. `latest_by_name` and the per-image `latest_version`
  resolve one at plan time instead. `name_prefix` narrows the list, results are
  sorted by name so they do not churn between plans, and an image with no
  published versions is listed with an empty `latest_version` rather than being
  dropped, so a reference to it fails on the empty value instead of on a
  missing map key.

- New `truenas_container_device` resource for attaching devices to the LXC
  containers TrueNAS introduced in 26.0: a bind-mounted host path, a GPU, a
  virtual NIC, or a passed-through USB device.

  Upstream models the device as one `attributes` object discriminated on a
  `dtype` field. This resource expresses that as four mutually exclusive
  blocks (`filesystem`, `gpu`, `nic`, `usb`) rather than a free-form map,
  because the four shapes share no fields: a map would accept any key and only
  fail server-side, and neither Terraform nor the docs could say what a valid
  device looks like. Setting none of them, or more than one, fails at plan
  time.

  The provider never asks the API to remove the raw file or ZFS volume behind a
  device: that storage has its own lifecycle and is not something detaching a
  device attachment was asked to touch. A device in use IS force-detached, so
  removing one from a running container works rather than failing.

  Rules that would otherwise only fail server-side are checked at plan time: a
  bind-mount source must be under `/mnt/`, neither path may contain braces, and
  a USB `vendor_id`/`product_id` pair must be set together and be hexadecimal.

  A device whose `dtype` this provider version does not model fails the read
  with a message saying so, rather than producing state with all four blocks
  empty that Terraform would plan as needing recreation on every run.

- New `truenas_container` resource for the LXC containers TrueNAS introduced
  in 26.0. Manages the image, pool, init process, capability policy and
  user-namespace ID mapping on the `container` namespace. Devices are not
  covered: they live in `container.device` upstream and are excluded from the
  container create model.

  Requires TrueNAS 26.0 or newer, with the same version-naming diagnostics and
  skip-not-fail acceptance tests as the other 26.0 resources.

  Three things came out of running this against a live 26.0-BETA.1 box rather
  than only against fakes:

  - `container.delete` changed shape mid-cycle. 26.0-BETA.1 takes the container
    ID alone and returns directly; later builds take an options argument and run
    as a job. The newer form is sent first and the older one is used when the
    server rejects the extra argument. The fallback matches only middleware's
    arity wording, so a real validation failure is never retried as a version
    problem.
  - `image` and `pool` exist only on the upstream create model, so no read
    returns them and an imported container has neither in state. Both are
    `RequiresReplace`, which made the first apply after an import destroy and
    recreate the container. That is now suppressed for exactly those two
    attributes and only while state has nothing to compare against.
  - The derived attributes (`dataset`, `default_network`, `status`) pin their
    planned value, without which `terraform plan` reported a change immediately
    after a successful apply, forever.

  `recursive` is never passed to `container.delete`. It destroys the container
  dataset's child datasets and snapshots, any clones of those snapshots anywhere
  in the pool, and any holds on them, none of which Terraform was asked to
  manage.

  `idmap` cannot express an unmapped container, where container root is host
  root. A container that is already unmapped upstream reads back as null rather
  than being reported as `DEFAULT`, so it shows in the plan instead of looking
  safer than it is.

- New `truenas_lxc_config` resource and `truenas_lxc_config` data source for
  the system-wide LXC container configuration TrueNAS introduced in 26.0.
  Manages `preferred_pool`, `bridge`, `v4_network` and `v6_network` on the
  `lxc` singleton.

  Requires TrueNAS 26.0 or newer. The `lxc` namespace does not exist on 25.10
  or earlier, so every operation there fails with a diagnostic naming the
  required version rather than an opaque method-not-found, and the acceptance
  tests skip on such a server rather than failing.

  A named `bridge` is validated against `lxc.bridge_choices` before the write,
  so an interface that does not exist is rejected with the valid choices
  listed. The `"[AUTO]"` sentinel that `lxc.bridge_choices` advertises for the
  automatic bridge is rejected at plan time with a message naming the spelling
  that works: TrueNAS stores it as a null that refreshes back as `""`, so a
  configuration using it can never converge, and Terraform forbids a provider
  rewriting a value the configuration set explicitly. Use `bridge = ""`, or
  omit it.

  `v4_network` and `v6_network` are checked at plan time for CIDR syntax,
  address family and TrueNAS's minimum of 4 addresses, so those failures name
  the attribute instead of arriving as a middleware validation error at apply
  time.

- New `truenas_share_webshare` resource for WebShare, the browser-based share
  protocol TrueNAS introduced in 26.0. Manages `name`, `path`, `enabled` and
  `is_home_base`; `dataset`, `relative_path` and `locked` are derived by
  middleware and exposed read-only, because they are `excluded_field()` on the
  upstream create model and a config setting them would be expressing
  something the server ignores.

  Requires TrueNAS 26.0 or newer. The `sharing.webshare` namespace does not
  exist on 25.10 or earlier, so every operation there fails with a diagnostic
  naming the required version rather than an opaque method-not-found. The
  acceptance tests skip on such a server rather than failing, and the sweeper
  treats the missing namespace as "nothing to reclaim" instead of a sweep
  failure.

- `truenas_smb_config` gained `search_protocols`, new in TrueNAS 26.0.
  Currently only `SPOTLIGHT` (macOS Spotlight). Version-gated the same way as
  `minimum_protocol`: it is only sent to a server that has the field, because
  the pre-26.0 models reject unknown keys, and asking for it against an older
  server is a clear error rather than a middleware validation failure.

- `truenas_pool` gained `force_topology`, new in TrueNAS 26.0, which bypasses
  topology policy validation to allow data vdevs that differ in type or width
  from the rest of the pool. Create-only, and only sent when explicitly set,
  so leaving it unset stays safe on every supported version.

- `truenas_vm_device` accepts the `ISCSI_DISK` device type, new in TrueNAS
  27.0. This unblocks plan-time validation for it; the nested
  targets/LUNs shape is not modelled yet, so it is usable through the
  attributes the resource already exposes.

- Optional `api_version` provider argument (and `TRUENAS_API_VERSION`) pins the
  WebSocket endpoint to a specific TrueNAS API version instead of
  `/api/current`. Pinning makes middleware run its `from_previous` /
  `to_previous` adapters, so fields renamed in a newer TrueNAS are translated
  server-side rather than arriving in their new shape.

  Deliberately opt-in, not the default. A pin cannot recover a method that went
  `@private`, and middleware raises when a model is missing from an
  intermediate version, so switching it on by default would trade known
  behaviour for unknown on every existing deployment. Unset keeps the exact
  endpoint every previous release dialled.

- `truenas_share_smb` gained an `options` block carrying the purpose-specific
  settings, and accepts the `FCP_SHARE` purpose.

  Without `options` the `EXTERNAL_SHARE` purpose could not be created at all:
  it is a DFS proxy, so it requires `remote_path`, and there was nowhere to put
  it. TrueNAS models `options` as a union keyed on `purpose` and rejects a
  field belonging to another member outright, so the pairing is checked at plan
  time rather than surfacing as `Extra inputs are not permitted` from the
  server. `FCP_SHARE` arrived upstream in 25.10.1 and the purpose validator had
  never learned it, so it was rejected on every release that supports it; the
  vocabulary is now one list feeding both the validator and the options map.

  `TIMEMACHINE_SHARE` and `FCP_SHARE` additionally need `aapl_extensions` on
  the global SMB config. Without it the create fails with an EINVAL naming
  `purpose` rather than the setting it wants, which is documented on the
  resource now.

### Changed

- **`truenas_system_update` was rewritten and its schema changed.** It called
  five `update.*` methods that do not exist in TrueNAS middleware and never
  did on any release this provider supports, so every plan touching it failed
  with a method-not-found before reaching anything else. It is now built on
  `update.config` / `update.update`. `auto_download` became `autocheck`, and
  `train` became `profile` because TrueNAS 26.0 replaced release trains with
  update profiles. Existing state migrates automatically: `autocheck` carries
  over, and `profile` is left empty for the next refresh, because a stored
  train name is not a valid profile and planning one would be rejected by the
  server. See issue #32.

- `truenas_user` gained `webshare`, new in TrueNAS 26.0. Not modelling it was
  a permanent break rather than a missing feature: middleware re-adds the
  `truenas_webshare` group on every update when the payload omits the field,
  so any account with it enabled failed every apply with "Provider produced
  inconsistent result after apply" and could not be repaired through
  configuration. Sent only on 26.0 and newer, since the field does not exist
  before that and those models reject unknown keys.

- The provider now detects the connected TrueNAS version once per session and
  uses it where behaviour genuinely differs per release, instead of guessing.
  An undetermined version is an error rather than a default, because choosing
  a wire format from a guess is how an apply reports success while writing the
  wrong thing.

- `truenas_service` now drives services through `service.control` instead of
  `service.start` / `service.stop`. Those two methods were removed from the
  public API in TrueNAS 26.0: from 25.10.0 they carried
  `removed_in="v26.04"`, and on 26.0 they are `@private`, which registers
  them on no endpoint at all. Pinning an older API version does not bring
  them back, so this was a hard break on 26.0 rather than a deprecation.

  No configuration changes are required, and no supported TrueNAS version
  loses support. `service.control` only exists from 25.10.0 onward, so on
  25.04 and older the provider falls back to `service.start` /
  `service.stop`, which is all those releases have. The fallback triggers
  only on a method-not-found response; any other error surfaces as-is
  rather than being retried against a second method.

  | TrueNAS | `service.control` | `service.start` / `.stop` | provider uses |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 25.04 and older | absent | present | legacy |
  | 25.10.x | present | present (deprecated) | `service.control` |
  | 26.0, 27.0 | present | `@private` | `service.control` |

- `truenas_smb_config` gained `minimum_protocol` (`SMB1` / `SMB2` / `SMB3`).
  TrueNAS 26.0 replaced the `enable_smb1` boolean with this tri-state field.
  Both sides are strict (`extra="forbid"`), so the wrong key is a hard
  validation error in either direction: `minimum_protocol` on 25.10 fails
  exactly as hard as `enable_smb1` on 26.0. The provider now detects which
  key the server speaks and sends that one, so `minimum_protocol` works on
  every supported version.

  `enable_smb1` is deprecated but still accepted and stays in sync with
  `minimum_protocol` automatically; setting both is an error. The mapping
  (`true` = `SMB1`, `false` = `SMB2`) is middleware's own, taken from its
  26.0 data migration. `SMB3` has no legacy equivalent, so requesting it
  against TrueNAS 25.10 or older is a clear error rather than a silent
  downgrade to `SMB2`.

- `truenas_user` gained `password_disabled`, and `password` is now Optional
  rather than Required. TrueNAS models passwordless accounts with a real
  `password_disabled` column, but the provider forced a password onto every
  managed user, so a service account that only owns files (an NFS `mapall`
  user, say) could not stay passwordless: any apply gave it a password.

  Exactly one of `password` or `password_disabled = true` is required when
  creating a user. The two cannot be combined, and `password_disabled`
  cannot be set on an SMB user, both of which TrueNAS rejects server-side
  and the provider now catches at plan time with an attribute path. Turning
  `password_disabled` back off requires supplying a `password` in the same
  change, otherwise the account would claim password login while its stored
  hash is still `*`.

  `password_disabled` is also exposed on the `truenas_user` data source.

### Removed

- Removed the `changie` configuration and its `.changelog/` directory, and
  corrected the release process that told maintainers to run it. `CHANGELOG.md`
  is hand-maintained and always has been: no per-PR entry file ever reached
  `main`, the `header.tpl.md` that `.changie.yaml` referenced was never added,
  and no release was ever batched into a version file. Running the documented
  `changie merge` against that state does not fail safe. Measured on the real
  repository, it truncated `CHANGELOG.md` from 227 entries to 0 while printing
  an error about the missing template. A test now fails if the file loses its
  `[Unreleased]` section or drops below an entry floor.

- Removed `internal/recordreplay/`. It was a record/replay proxy for the REST
  API, orphaned by the v2.0 WebSocket cutover: nothing in the module ever
  imported it, and it could not be adapted. It forwards with a plain
  `http.Client.Do`, which cannot proxy the connection upgrade a WebSocket
  needs, and it keys its fixtures on HTTP method plus path plus query, which
  JSON-RPC over one socket does not have, because every call is the same
  request to `/api/current`. CI was enforcing a 100% coverage floor on it, so
  the repo paid test-maintenance cost on 765 lines nothing called, and
  `docs/guides/architecture.md` advertised it as a "record/replay proxy for
  live-API-free CI", a capability that did not exist. If that capability is
  ever wanted it belongs as a recording wrapper around
  `wsclient.TestHandler`, where the frames are already decoded.

### Fixed

- `TestAccValidator_Certificate_lifetimeOutOfRange` passed on the wrong
  diagnostic. Its configuration also set
  `create_type = "CERTIFICATE_CREATE_INTERNAL"`, which is not in the
  `create_type` OneOf, so the step failed for two reasons and the assertion
  could not tell them apart. Split into one case per rule, and the lifetime one
  now asserts what is actually true: the attribute is read-only.

- `acme_directory_uri = ""` and `dns_mapping = {}` passed the new required-field
  check and were then erased from the request by `omitempty`, so the server saw
  them missing and answered with exactly the error the check exists to prevent.
  Presence is not a value test: both now carry the non-empty rule upstream
  declares (`NonEmptyString`, and a mapping that must cover every domain), as
  do `csr` and `certificate`.

- A failed `san` or `dns_mapping` conversion did not stop the create. Both only
  appended a diagnostic, so the request went out with the field missing:
  Terraform reported an error while the server made a certificate with the
  wrong subject alternative names and no state to manage it by.

- `terraform import` proposed destroying and re-issuing a CSR or ACME
  certificate. `ImportState` assumed `CERTIFICATE_CREATE_IMPORTED` for
  everything and `create_type` forces replacement, so importing one and
  planning against the configuration that describes it planned a replace. For
  an ACME certificate that means re-issuing from the CA. The record says
  enough to derive it: `cert_type_CSR` marks an unsigned request and
  `acme_uri` is set only on one issued through ACME.

- `acme_directory_uri = ""` and `dns_mapping = {}` passed the new required-field
  check and were then erased from the request by `omitempty`, so the server saw
  them missing and answered with exactly the error the check exists to prevent.
  Presence is not a value test: both now carry the non-empty rule upstream
  declares, as does `csr`.

- A failed `san` or `dns_mapping` conversion did not stop the create. Both only
  appended a diagnostic, so the request went out with the field missing:
  Terraform reported an error while the server made a certificate with the
  wrong subject alternative names and no state to manage it by.

- `terraform import` proposed destroying and re-issuing a CSR or ACME
  certificate. `ImportState` assumed `CERTIFICATE_CREATE_IMPORTED` for
  everything and `create_type` forces replacement, so importing one and
  planning against the configuration that describes it planned a replace. For
  an ACME certificate that means re-issuing from the CA. The record says enough
  to derive it: `cert_type_CSR` marks an unsigned request and `acme_uri` is set
  only on one issued through ACME.

- `truenas_certificate.lifetime` was a settable argument that could not be set.
  `certificate.create` has no `lifetime` field on any supported version; it is
  on the query model only. Setting it passed plan, was never sent, and was then
  either overwritten from the parsed certificate or kept in state as a value
  the server had never been told. It is Computed-only now, so a configuration
  that sets it says so at plan time.

- The `truenas_certificate` page advertised a 20m create timeout in its
  description and 10m in its timeouts section. Neither was true: **no resource
  in this provider reads its `timeouts` block.** All 68 declare one, the
  invariant that guards them checks only that the block is declared, and
  nothing consumes the value. The page now says so rather than quoting a
  default that does not apply. Filed as an issue; wiring it through 68
  resources is its own change.

- The provider's own documented ACME workflow could not be planned. `ModifyPlan`
  treated an UNKNOWN configuration value as unset, and
  `csr_id = truenas_certificate.csr.id` is unknown on a first apply, so
  `terraform plan` on the two-resource example failed with "Missing csr_id",
  the same class of unusable-`create_type` error the ACME work set out to
  remove. Presence is now `IsNull` alone, which is what every validator in the
  framework does; unknown means "set, value pending". The same reading applies
  in reverse to the rejection direction, so an unknown ACME field on a
  non-ACME `create_type` is still refused, and to `san`, `key_type` and
  `key_length`, whose value-dependent rules cannot run on an unknown and are
  now left to the server.

- `create_type = "CERTIFICATE_CREATE_IMPORTED_CSR"` was offered by the schema
  and documented, and could not succeed. Its payload model is
  `name` + `CSR` + `privatekey`, and the provider had no attribute for the
  request itself. A new `csr` attribute carries it, required for that
  `create_type` and rejected on every other one. This is the same defect as
  the ACME one, in the create_type next to it.

- The ACME example's `dns_mapping` keys could not match. TrueNAS compares the
  keys as written against the CSR's stored domain list, where every `san`
  carries its general-name kind, so a bare `san` name is refused with
  "not specified in the CSR" unless it also happens to be the common name.
  The example and the argument reference now key each `san` as
  `DNS:name`.

- The Cloudflare authenticator examples set `cloudflare_api_key`, which is not
  a field on any supported version. `CloudFlareSchema` is `cloudflare_email`,
  `api_key` and `api_token`, and the model forbids unknown keys, so the
  authenticator create was rejected. Corrected in
  `truenas_certificate` and in `truenas_acme_dns_authenticator`, where it had
  been wrong since the example was written.

- Half the acceptance suite never ran. `scripts/acc.sh`, the pipeline whose own
  banner calls it the full acceptance suite, listed only `internal/resources`
  and `internal/datasources`. `internal/provider` carries **192** `TestAcc`
  functions and was not on that line, so `make acc` reported success without
  having run any of them. They were reachable only through `make testacc`,
  which nothing in the documented flow calls.

- The acceptance packages raced each other over a single appliance. Ten
  singleton config resources are exercised from both of them: `smb_config`,
  `nfs_config`, `ssh_config`, `snmp_config`, `mail_config`, `ftp_config`,
  `systemdataset`, `network_config`, `ups_config` and `kmip_config`. Run
  concurrently, whichever test loses the race fails on state the other one set.
  Caught on a real run: a `TIMEMACHINE_SHARE` preset test in one package turns
  `aapl_extensions` on, and `TestAccSMBConfigResource_update` in the other died
  with "This option must be enabled when AFP, time machine, or Final Cut Pro
  shares are present", on a tree where both pass in isolation. Both runners now
  pass `-p 1`.

  `TestAccPackagesAreInAccRunner` and `TestAccRunnerIsSerial` hold both of
  these, and are verified by mutation: dropping the package from the list, or
  the flag from either runner, fails them.

- Changing `renew_days` on a `truenas_certificate` did nothing. Update sent
  only `name`, so the new value went into state without ever reaching the
  server. Upstream's `CertificateUpdate` model takes `renew_days`, `name` and
  `add_to_trusted_store`, so `renew_days` is now sent and changes in place.

- Changing `tos`, `csr_id`, `acme_directory_uri` or `dns_mapping` on an
  existing `truenas_certificate` did nothing either, and unlike the attributes
  read back off the certificate it failed silently: nothing in the response
  overwrites them, so state ended up claiming a value the server had never
  been told. None of the four can change on a certificate that already exists,
  so they now force replacement.

- `truenas_certificate` could not create an ACME certificate at all, and could
  not create a CSR from a common name. Reported as
  [#33](https://github.com/PjSalty/terraform-provider-truenas/issues/33).

  `create_type = "CERTIFICATE_CREATE_ACME"` was offered by the schema and
  documented, but the provider had no `tos`, `csr_id`, `acme_directory_uri`,
  `renew_days` or `dns_mapping` to send, so every attempt came back rejecting
  three fields nobody could set. TrueNAS validates the create in two passes: a
  public model where those default to null, then a per-`create_type` model that
  declares them non-nullable. All five now exist as attributes and are sent.

  A CSR was rejected the same way from the other direction. The provider
  required "`common` or at least one `san`", where the server requires a
  non-empty `san` outright and, for an RSA key, `key_length` with it. Both are
  now checked at plan time, so the configuration fails before the apply instead
  of during it.

  The ACME attributes are also refused at plan time on any other `create_type`,
  which is what the server does with them.

- `truenas_certificate` reported a permanent diff on `san`. A configuration
  asking for `example.com` got `DNS:example.com` back from the parsed
  certificate, and the next plan proposed changing it back forever. The two
  spellings now compare equal, and so do the two OpenSSL uses for an IP entry
  (`IP:` and `IP Address:`) and for a registered ID (`RID:` and
  `RegisteredID:`). Two different kinds on the same name stay different.

- A `CERTIFICATE_CREATE_CSR` apply ended in "Provider produced inconsistent
  result after apply". TrueNAS reads `certificate`, `digest_algorithm` and
  `lifetime` off a signed certificate, and a CSR has none, so it reports them
  as `""`, `""` and `0` whatever was asked for. The provider wrote those empties
  over what the practitioner had configured. It now keeps the configured value
  when the API has nothing to report, and still overwrites for a `create_type`
  that does report them, so an out-of-band change is still seen.

- `truenas_certificate` built its `san` list with the wrong element type, so
  the value could not convert into state. The error was discarded rather than
  reported.

- `truenas_certificate` accepted `key_length = 1024`, which no supported
  TrueNAS has ever taken: the model is `Literal[2048, 4096]`. It passed plan
  and failed at apply.

- The docs invariant that compares a documented "Valid values" list against its
  validator searched to the end of the file for a `stringvalidator.OneOf`, so
  an attribute validated with `int64validator.OneOf` silently borrowed the next
  string one it found and was checked against the wrong set. Bounded to the
  attribute's own block, and numeric value sets are now read. That found
  `truenas_iscsi_extent.blocksize` documented as "512 or 4096" where the API
  takes 512, 1024, 2048 and 4096.

- `truenas_system_update` still described itself as managing `auto_download`
  and a release `train` on the Registry page, which are the two attributes its
  rewrite renamed. The schema had moved to `autocheck` and `profile`; only the
  prose was left behind.

- `docs/RELEASING.md` documented a release process that does not exist. It
  described opening PRs against a `dev` branch and a `promote` job that reads
  the version out of `CHANGELOG.md` and tags automatically. There is no `dev`
  branch, `.gitlab-ci.yml` has no promote job, and every tag from v2.1.0 on
  was made by hand, so the runbook's "happy path" was unfollowable and its
  emergency path was the real one. Rewritten to the process that exists,
  including a step that verifies the published release has assets rather than
  just a tag that resolves.

  It also documents that `PROMOTE_TOKEN`, a Project Access Token with
  `api + write_repository` and Maintainer role, is still set as a CI variable
  and is read by nothing.

- `testdata/fuzz/README.md` was six months stale. It listed 8 fuzz targets
  where the repo has 99, and the one smoke-run command it offered ran against
  `./internal/client/`, a package deleted in the v2.0 WebSocket cutover, so it
  could not work. Rewritten to per-package counts, with
  `TestFuzzReadmeMatchesTargets` and `TestFuzzReadmeCommandsPointAtRealPackages`
  asserting the counts and the commands against the code so it cannot rot
  silently again.

- Four acceptance tests had been switched off behind env gates long enough to
  rot, and turning them on found three real defects:

  - `catalog_data_test.go` set `id = "TRUENAS"` on a data source whose `id` is
    Computed, so the step died with "Cannot set value for this attribute as the
    provider has marked it as read-only". The catalog is a singleton; there is
    nothing to select by.
  - `reporting_exporter_test.go` import-verified `attributes_json`, which
    TrueNAS enriches with its own defaults (`buffer_on_failures`,
    `matching_charts`, `send_names_instead_of_ids`, `update_every`). A sparse
    configuration cannot match an enriched read. The provider-package copy of
    this test already ignored the field for the same reason.
  - The same tests used fixed resource names, so one failed run left an
    exporter behind and every later run died on "Specified name is already in
    use", which reads like a provider fault rather than leftover state. They
    are unique per run now.

  The `truenas_catalog` data source also described `id` as "always 'catalog'
  for the singleton". A live box returns the label, `TRUENAS`.

- `TestAcceptanceConfigsMatchSchema` checks the inline terraform in every
  acceptance test against the schema, the way the examples and docs are already
  checked. 461 resource and data blocks across 360 configurations. The
  read-only `id` above is exactly what it catches, and catching it needed a
  live run against an env-gated test before this existed.

- Nothing validated `.goreleaser.yml` until a tag was pushed, which is the
  worst moment to learn it is broken: `release.yml` fires only on `v*`. CI now
  runs `goreleaser check` on every push, under the same `~> v2` constraint the
  release job uses so the two cannot disagree about what the config means.

  `check` validates the schema and nothing else. It does not expand a single
  template, so a `name_template` of `{{ .Broken }}` passes it and fails at
  release time. The weekly scheduled run therefore also does a full snapshot
  build, which expands every template, produces all seven archives and the
  checksums, and exercises the SBOM step with syft the way the release job
  does. Nothing is published: `--snapshot` with `--skip=publish,sign`.

  `make release-check` runs the schema check locally. It needs goreleaser 2.6
  or newer, because the `archives.formats` key this config uses replaced the
  older singular `format`; an older v2 reports it as an unknown field, which
  reads like the config is broken when the tool is what is stale.

- **`make prod-ready` could not run.** The target whose own help says "run this
  before any tag" invoked `./internal/client` seven times, a package deleted in
  the v2.0 WebSocket cutover, and `make` stops at the first failing line. So
  everything after it never ran either: the strict static analysis, the docs and
  examples ratchet, and the acceptance-coverage ratchet were all unreachable,
  while the target still ended by printing "safe to tag".

  Every safety rail it claimed still exists; they moved packages and changed
  names. The read-only rail is `TestIsReadOnlyMethod` and `TestCheckReadOnly` in
  `wsclient`, destroy protection is `TestIsDestructiveMethod` and
  `TestCheckDestroyProtection`, fault injection is the `TestChaos_` family, and
  redaction is `TestRedact*`. Each line now points at a test that exists, and
  each was confirmed to match a non-zero number of tests rather than silently
  matching none.

  Two of the old assertions do not carry over to JSON-RPC and are gone rather
  than faked: an `X-Request-ID` header has no equivalent when the id is a
  protocol field, and retries deliberately mint a fresh id, since reusing one
  across a reconnect could correlate with a stale response. `TestNextRequestID`
  covers what remains.

  The gate also picked up the invariants added since it broke: the acceptance
  idempotency ratchet, the examples and doc-snippet schema checks, and the API
  value-set check.

- The SMB preset compatibility test skipped `EXTERNAL_SHARE` with the reason
  "truenas_share_smb exposes no preset-options map". That was true when it was
  written and stopped being true when the `options` block landed, so a test
  whose whole purpose is to cycle **every** preset was silently skipping the
  one that had been broken. It runs now, along with `FCP_SHARE`, which was
  never in the list at all.

  Eight of the nine presets are exercised against a live box.
  `VEEAM_REPOSITORY_SHARE` still skips: it needs an enterprise license.

- The Kubernetes storage guide could not have worked. It used `groups { }` and
  `listen { }` where the schema declares nested attributes, and passed the
  portal's tag where the API wants its id. Fixing the iSCSI resource in the
  previous change corrected the copy under `docs/` and left
  `templates/guides/`, which is what `tfplugindocs generate` repopulates from,
  so the fix would have been reverted the next time anyone regenerated.

  The schema check now walks `docs/guides/` and `templates/guides/` as well as
  `docs/resources/`. A guide is prose with configuration in it, and the
  configuration goes just as stale. It also handles a fenced block indented
  inside a numbered list, which it had been running straight past.
- The documented "Valid values" lists were left behind by the validator fixes
  above, so the Registry page still advertised `GZIP-2` through `GZIP-8` on
  `truenas_dataset.compression`, still capped `record_size` at `1M`, still
  named `BACKBLAZE_B2`, and still told you `truenas_vm.name` accepted only
  alphanumerics. `truenas_directoryservices.service_type` was worse than stale:
  its list had been rendered as `` `, `, `, ` `` and named nothing at all.

  These lists are hand-written prose, and prose does not move when a validator
  does. A test now compares every documented list to the resource's own `OneOf`,
  in both directions, so a doc cannot advertise a value that fails at plan or
  hide one that works. 55 lists are covered.

- **`idmap = { type = "ISOLATED" }` could not create a container**, which is
  verbatim the snippet in the provider's own published example and what the
  docs tell you to write to let TrueNAS pick a slice.

  Upstream declares `slice: PositiveInt | None` with no default, so pydantic
  requires the KEY for `ISOLATED` even though its VALUE may be null, and null
  is what asks the backend to choose. The wire struct tagged it `omitempty`, so
  an unset slice dropped the key entirely and middleware answered
  `container_create.idmap.ISOLATED.slice: Field required`. The fix is
  discriminator-aware rather than a blanket tag change: `DEFAULT` forbids
  extras, so it must not carry the key at all.

- **An iSCSI target group could not omit its initiator group**, which is
  upstream's default and means "allow any initiator". Two separate faults
  stacked: the schema marked `initiator` Required, and the wire struct typed it
  as a plain `int`, so an omitted value serialized as `0`. There is no group
  with id 0, so the create failed on a foreign key rather than on anything a
  practitioner could act on:

  ```
  (sqlite3.IntegrityError) FOREIGN KEY constraint failed
  ```

  `auth` had the same shape and is now nullable too, and `authmethod` falls
  back to the upstream default rather than an empty string.

  The published example also passed the portal's **tag** where the API wants
  its **id**, so it could not have worked either. Nothing caught that because
  no acceptance test set `groups` at all; the target tests all create bare
  targets.

- `truenas_dns_nameserver` rejected the empty string, so a nameserver could not
  be cleared. Upstream types these as `Literal[''] | <an IP>`, and this
  resource's own Delete already clears them that way internally. The regex was
  also wrong in the other direction: it accepted `999.999.999.999` and rejected
  `::ffff:1.2.3.4`, because it only counted digits and colons. It parses the
  address now.

- `truenas_api_key.username` was capped at 32 characters. Upstream is
  `LocalUsername | RemoteUsername` and only the local arm has that cap, so an
  ordinary Active Directory UPN was rejected.

- `truenas_snmp_config.v3_privproto` offered an empty string that no supported
  version accepts. Leave the attribute unset for no encryption.

- **Six name rules rejected values TrueNAS accepts.** Same shape as the value
  sets above: a regex written once and never checked against upstream again.

  - `truenas_user.username` was lowercase-only with no dot, so `John` and
    `john.doe` were both impossible. Upstream allows any ASCII letter, digit,
    underscore, dash or dot, starting with a letter or underscore.
  - `truenas_group.name` had the same pattern, and upstream is wider still: a
    group may start with a digit or a dot and has no length cap at all.
  - `truenas_vm.name` was alphanumeric-only, so `web_server` was impossible.
    Upstream types it as `NonEmptyString` with no character rule.
  - `truenas_iscsi_target.name` required the first character to be
    alphanumeric. Upstream is `^[-a-z0-9.:]+$`, which does not.
  - `truenas_ftp_config.filemask` and `dirmask` required 3 or 4 octal digits.
    Upstream parses the value and requires `mode & 0o777 == mode`, so `1777`
    passed plan and failed at apply while `77` was refused despite being valid.

  Two of them were also too permissive: `username` and `name` accepted a
  trailing `$`, which upstream rejects, so a Samba-style machine account name
  planned cleanly and failed on apply.

  A group and a user with dots and mixed case were created against a live
  26.0.0-BETA.1 to confirm the relaxation is real rather than inferred.

- **Six attributes rejected values the TrueNAS API accepts**, so they could not
  be configured at all. Each `OneOf` had been written once and never checked
  against upstream again.

  - `truenas_dataset.compression` and `truenas_zvol.compression` refused every
    graded ZSTD level. `ZSTD-1` through `ZSTD-19` and the whole `ZSTD-FAST-N`
    family are valid on every supported release; the provider offered 18 of the
    51 values, and 8 of those (`GZIP-2` through `GZIP-8`) have never been valid
    on any of them, so they passed plan and failed at apply.
  - `truenas_dataset.record_size` stopped at `1M`, rejecting `2M`, `4M`, `8M`,
    `16M` and `512B`.
  - `truenas_smb_config.unixcharset` allowed six of 87 charsets, and four of
    the six were spelled the way Samba writes them rather than the way the API
    does (`ISO-8859-1` for `ISO8859_1`, `EUC-JP` for `EUC_JP`), so two thirds
    of what it advertised was rejected on apply.
  - `truenas_cloudsync_credential.provider_type` was missing `BOX`,
    `GOOGLE_PHOTOS`, `HUBIC` and `STORJ_IX`, and offered `BACKBLAZE_B2`, which
    no version has ever accepted; the provider is called `B2`.
  - `truenas_service.service` rejected `nvmet` and `webshare`, both of which
    exist on a 26.0 box. Nothing was removed from that list: upstream types the
    field as a plain string rather than a Literal, so it is a convenience list,
    and dropping names that still exist on 25.10 would break those users.

  `ZSTD-19`, `ZSTD-FAST-10` and a `4M` record size were applied against a live
  26.0.0-BETA.1 to confirm the widening is real rather than inferred.

- The API drift check now covers value sets, not just methods. `scripts/api-drift.sh`
  caught a method upstream removed and said nothing about a value upstream
  accepts that the provider refuses, which is exactly how the six above drifted:
  the method was still there the whole time. The sets are recorded in
  `internal/provider/testdata/value_sets.json` with the source of each, a unit
  test compares them to the `OneOf` validators with no TrueNAS and no network,
  and the drift script re-derives the model-backed ones from upstream so a new
  release surfaces the difference.
- Every acceptance step that applies a configuration now asserts that the
  following plan is empty. 324 of the 390 did not, so a resource could produce
  a diff on every plan after a clean apply and the suite would still pass: the
  apply succeeds, the `Check` functions pass, and nothing looks at what the
  refresh brought back. That matters most for `Optional`+`Computed` attributes,
  which read server defaults into state.

  The ratchet added alongside this had the same hole in miniature. It accepted
  any `ConfigPlanChecks` as a gate, but 54 steps set only `PreApply`, which
  asserts what the plan will do and nothing about what the apply leaves behind.
  It now requires `PostApplyPostRefresh` specifically, and the ceiling is zero.

  134 steps stay exempt because they never reach an apply whose idempotency
  could be checked: 82 expect a non-empty plan deliberately (81 of them delete
  the resource out of band), 34 are plan-only, 17 expect an error, one is an
  import round-trip.

- **`EXTERNAL_SHARE` on `truenas_share_smb` could not be created**, even after
  the `options` block landed. Cross-field validation required
  `path = "EXTERNAL"` while the `path` attribute's own regex still demanded
  `/mnt/`, so the two contradicted each other and every configuration failed at
  plan with `SMB share path must start with /mnt/, got: EXTERNAL`.

  Schema validators run before `ValidateConfig`, so no `ValidateConfig` test
  could reach them, and statement coverage is blind to validators because they
  are declarative data rather than statements. The path validator now admits
  the sentinel, anchored so `EXTERNALISH` stays rejected, and the other
  direction is checked too: `EXTERNAL` is only valid for that one purpose.

- Twenty-five published examples named attributes the provider does not have,
  so copying the canonical usage out of the Registry could not plan. Forty-eight
  defects in total: attributes that are not in the schema, renamed ones
  (`sudo_commands_nopasswd`, `shutdown_timer`, `auto_download`, `train`), block
  syntax where the schema declares a nested attribute (`listen {}`, `groups {}`,
  and `schedule {}` on five task resources that have flat `schedule_minute`
  fields), and assignments to computed-only attributes.

  Nothing had ever checked them: the existing test proved only that an example
  parses as HCL, and the acceptance tests use their own inline configurations
  and never read `examples/`. Both the examples and the snippets embedded in
  `docs/` are now checked against the real schema.

- All 40 unit tests disabled by the v2.0 WebSocket cutover run again (issue #2).
  They were httptest fixtures against the REST API, skipped rather than
  rewritten when the transport changed, so the branches they covered had been
  unverified since. They now drive the same assertions through
  `wsclient.NewTestServer`. The REST-era test machinery they were the last
  users of is gone with them: `newTestServer`, `newTestServerClient`,
  `writeJSON`, and both `skipWSCutover` helpers.

- The `TIMEMACHINE_SHARE` SMB preset is covered by an acceptance test again. It
  was skipped with "provider does not manage that yet", referring to the
  `aapl_extensions` toggle on the global SMB config. The provider does manage
  it, on `truenas_smb_config`, so the test now composes one and depends on it.
  The same comment claimed the preset was gated behind `TRUENAS_TEST_SMB_AAPL`;
  no such gate was ever implemented, so setting that variable did nothing.

- The acceptance-coverage ratchet counted resources whose only `TestAcc`
  function is an unconditional `t.Skip` as covered, so it reported 68 when 64
  resources actually have a test that runs anything. Those four are now
  reported as a separate, named "stub-only" list instead of inflating the
  number. Their skip messages also told operators to "enable with TF_ACC=1 and
  TRUENAS_TEST_...", which does nothing: the functions have no body to enable,
  and no such gate was ever implemented.

- Renovate no longer targets a dead branch. `renovate.json` pinned
  `baseBranches` to `dev`, which last moved on 2026-06-12 and is 82 commits
  behind `main` with nothing of its own, so dependency and security updates
  were being raised against two-month-old code and then closed by hand. The
  pin is removed rather than repointed, so it follows the repository's default
  branch and cannot go stale the same way again.

- iSCSI portal and scrub-task acceptance tests now skip, naming the cause, when
  the target TrueNAS already has the one object middleware allows. A box with a
  pre-existing wildcard portal (a CSI driver's, or litter from an aborted run)
  or an existing scrub task previously failed every one of those tests
  identically, after a minute of applying, with an error that reads like a
  provider defect rather than an environment collision.

- The provider's offline plan/apply/refresh/destroy integration tests run again.
  They drove a stateful mock through the real provider factory to catch
  protocol-level regressions that handler unit tests cannot see, and the v2.0
  WebSocket cutover left all of them skipped because the mock spoke REST, so
  that layer had no offline verification at all. The mock now dispatches on
  JSON-RPC method names; the state it keeps and the bodies it builds were
  always transport-agnostic. Two of the tests were also strengthened:
  `ReadOnly_AllowsRead` had no data source in its config, so it never read
  anything despite its name, and the drift test asserted only a non-empty plan,
  which cannot tell "correctly detected as gone" from "Read returned something
  wrong".

- Corrected the package and code comments that still described the REST client
  deleted in v2.0. `internal/types` documented a migration policy for moving
  types out of `internal/client` "after v2.0 (Phase 5) deletes" it, which had
  already happened; `internal/wsclient` said the REST client "is being migrated
  method-by-method". Worse, `provider.go` pointed readers at
  `internal/client/readonly.go` and `internal/client/destroy_protection.go` for
  the read-only and destroy-protection gates. Those files do not exist; both
  gates live in `internal/wsclient/`. The feature-request issue template also
  asked contributors for a REST endpoint (`POST /api/v2.0/...`) rather than a
  JSON-RPC method name.

- The acceptance-test precheck invariant was blind to an entire package. Its
  function regex matched only the `TestAcc` prefix, but `internal/datasources`
  names its acceptance tests `Test<X>DataSourceAcc`, so the guard walked 42
  files there and checked nothing while reporting PASS. It now matches both
  conventions. Removed the 23 unconditional `t.Skip` acceptance stubs in that
  package at the same time: they could never run, every one of those files
  already has real unit tests, and they were the only thing the widened guard
  would have had to excuse.

- `truenas_replication.source_datasets` rejects an empty list. The API accepts
  one on update, so a replication task could be left with no sources: it then
  replicates nothing while the apply still reports success and the plan is
  clean afterwards.
- `truenas_cloud_backup.password` rejects the empty string, which reached the
  API and came back as a generic middleware validation error naming nothing
  useful.

- Two acceptance tests asserted things that could never happen, so they failed
  on every `TF_ACC` run. `TestAccValidator_DNSNameserver_rejectsGarbage` set an
  `address` argument that `truenas_dns_nameserver` has never had (the attribute
  is `nameserver1`), so Terraform answered "Unsupported argument" instead of the
  validator message the test was looking for.
  `TestAccValidator_ISCSITargetExtent_lunidAtLeast` expected "must be at least"
  from an `int64validator.Between(0, 1023)`, which emits "must be between". Both
  now assert the diagnostic the validator actually produces, and both stale doc
  comments above them were corrected rather than left describing validators that
  are not there.

- Acceptance-test sweepers work again on TrueNAS 26.0. They listed fixtures with
  HTTP GETs against `/api/v2.0`, and 26.0 removed the REST API: every one of
  those 29 calls answers **404**. Because the plugin-testing framework aborts a
  sweep run on the first sweeper error, one dead call stopped every later
  sweeper from running, so test litter accumulated silently until a rerun
  collided with it. Listing now goes over the same JSON-RPC WebSocket as
  production resource I/O. Verified on a live 26.0 box: all 46 sweepers run, 0
  errors, where previously the run aborted after 1.

- The `truenas_api_key` sweeper no longer revokes the credential it is
  authenticated with. A test key is conventionally named `tf-acc-...` and so
  matched the same prefix every other fixture does; deleting it left every
  sweeper scheduled afterwards failing unauthenticated. The sweeper now derives
  the live key's row id from `TRUENAS_API_KEY` the same way middleware does
  (`int(key.split('-', 1)[0])`, reading only the id half, never the secret) and
  skips that row. When the id cannot be read it refuses to delete any key
  rather than guessing: an unswept key is litter, a revoked one takes out the
  test box.


- `truenas_pool` now validates `encryption_options_json` against the connected
  server before creating the pool. The map is forwarded verbatim into a strict
  middleware submodel, and two of its keys changed in TrueNAS 26.0:
  `algorithm` was removed, and the `pbkdf2iters` minimum rose from 100000 to
  1300000. `algorithm` was the exact key the provider's own schema description
  and docs told users to write, so following the documentation is what broke
  the apply. Both keys remain valid on 25.10 and are only rejected against a
  server that actually rejects them.

- Authentication against TrueNAS 27 now explains itself.
  `auth.login_with_api_key` is removed there, and without a configured
  `username` the provider has no other handshake, so it surfaced as a bare
  method-not-found naming only the method. It now names the version and the
  fix. A warning is also logged whenever the legacy handshake is used, so the
  deprecation is visible before it bites.

- `auth.login_ex` responses of type `DENIED`, new in TrueNAS 26.0, now report
  that the credential lacks API access. Previously they fell through as an
  unexpected response type, which pointed at neither the cause nor the fix.

- Importing a passwordless `truenas_user` no longer requires inventing a
  password for it. `ImportState` used to seed `password` with an empty
  string, which then failed the non-empty validator on the next plan, so
  the first apply after an import set a password on an account that
  deliberately had none.

- `truenas_smb_config` no longer sends `enable_smb1` on every apply. The
  attribute carried a static `false` default, which made its planned value
  always known, so the update body included the key even for configs that
  never mentioned it, and the reset path sent it unconditionally. On
  TrueNAS 26.0 that key is rejected outright, so a resource nobody had
  customised would fail both update and destroy. The default is gone and
  the protocol key is only sent when a protocol is actually requested.

- A service that failed to start or stop no longer reports a successful
  apply. `service.control` (and `service.start` before it) defaults
  `options.silent` to `true`, which answers a failed operation with a
  *successful* job whose result is `false` rather than with an error. The
  previous code discarded that bool, so a service that never came up still
  produced a clean apply and Terraform recorded it as running. The provider
  now sends `silent: false` so middleware raises the real diagnostic, and
  additionally treats a `false` result as an error.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-07-27

### Security

- Bumped `google.golang.org/grpc` to v1.82.1 for GO-2026-6061 (HTTP/2
  transport server and xDS RBAC). `govulncheck` reports the vulnerable
  code as reachable from `providerserver.Serve`, the gRPC server the
  provider runs for Terraform, so this is a real patch rather than a
  routine dependency bump.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-26

### Changed

- Provider auth: a new optional `username` argument (or `TRUENAS_USERNAME`)
  switches the WebSocket handshake to `auth.login_ex` with the
  `API_KEY_PLAIN` mechanism, which is the call that remains in TrueNAS 27.
  Without it the provider keeps using `auth.login_with_api_key`, which
  TrueNAS deprecates in 26 and removes in 27, so set `username` before
  upgrading to 27. Every `login_ex` response type maps to an actionable
  error, and an unknown `username` fails loudly rather than silently
  selecting the deprecated mechanism (closes #25).

### Security

- Bumped `golang.org/x/text` to v0.39.0 for GO-2026-5970.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- `truenas_app`: custom Docker Compose apps via the new `custom_compose`
  attribute (requested in #24). Exactly one of `catalog_app` (now optional)
  or `custom_compose` is set; compose content edits apply in place, and
  converting between catalog and custom forces replacement. Comparison is
  semantic: formatting, comments, key order, and YAML 1.1 bool spellings
  never plan as diffs, while structural drift against the server's stored
  compose surfaces on refresh. Custom apps destroy with
  `force_remove_custom_app` so a broken compose cannot wedge a destroy.

### Fixed

- Acceptance test debt on `truenas_app`: the catalog test installed minio,
  which left the TrueNAS catalog in 2026, and import verification raced the
  volatile `state` attribute. Swapped to syncthing and ignored `state` on
  import with a documented rationale.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- `truenas_directory`: mode now validates as permission bits (000-777,
  leading zero allowed) instead of accepting 4-digit modes the TrueNAS API
  always rejects at apply; special bits read back from disk are ignored
  rather than reported as drift. The middleware `UnixPerm` type behind
  mkdir and setperm cannot set setuid/setgid/sticky bits. Reported with a
  precise diagnosis by @chuwy, fixes #17.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- `truenas_network_interface`: PHYSICAL interface support. Create adopts and
  configures the existing NIC via `interface.update`, destroy is state-only
  removal (hardware cannot be deleted), import by name. Based on GitHub PR #23
  by @chuwy, fixes #15.

### Fixed

- `truenas_user`: groups is now an unordered set, so server-side ordering
  differences no longer cause drift or "inconsistent result after apply"
  errors. Based on GitHub PR #20 by @chuwy, fixes #19.
- `truenas_directory`: applied values win over a stale post-apply stat. A
  `filesystem.stat` right after setperm can return stale uid/gid/mode
  (TrueNAS caching); state now keeps the planned mode and uid/gid, using stat
  only for values the plan did not set. Based on GitHub PR #22 by @chuwy,
  fixes #21.
- `truenas_directory`: import now seeds `create_parents=false`, so
  `ImportStateVerify` no longer fails on a null create_parents (the attribute
  is config-only mkdir -p behavior).
- `truenas_network_interface`: rollback attribute now has a real schema
  default of true, and the commit checkin window stays at the 60 second
  middleware default; a 5 second window raced the client retry backoff and
  could auto-revert legitimate changes.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- `truenas_directory` resource: manage a directory on a TrueNAS SCALE
  filesystem via `filesystem.mkdir` / `filesystem.stat` / `filesystem.setperm`.
  Path-keyed (the id is the path), with `mode`, `create_parents` (mkdir -p
  semantics), and `uid`/`gid`. Delete is state-only: TrueNAS exposes no
  directory-removal API, so destroy drops the directory from Terraform state
  and leaves it on disk (#14).

### Changed

- Kubernetes storage guide now recommends truenas-csi over the legacy
  REST-only democratic-csi driver, which stops working on TrueNAS 26.

### Fixed

- Dropped a redundant int conversion flagged by the unconvert linter.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Documentation and example refresh; no
  functional changes. Registry-rendered docs now match the repo
  style guide.
- Test-infrastructure lint debt cleared (contextcheck, gosec
  permissions, staticcheck escapes); no provider runtime changes.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added (rc.4, multi-version validation, 2026-06-09/10)

- **Validation matrix across three live SCALE lines.** The full
  acceptance suite was executed against real instances of each:
  - SCALE **25.10**: 147/147 PASS, the fully-supported floor.
  - SCALE **25.04**: 126/141, every failure is an upstream API
    absence (`nvmet.*` arrived in 25.10, unified
    `directoryservices.*`, 25.10 SMB `purpose` vocabulary, newer
    `alert_service` types), not a provider defect. Documented as
    partial support in the version matrix.
  - SCALE **26.0-BETA.1**: 143/147, four failures from 26.0 API
    drift (`service.start` signature, SMB config shape), tracked
    for a v2.x release alongside 26.0 final.
- **WebSocket acceptance preflight** (`cmd/wspreflight`): the acc
  harness probes `system.info` + `pool.query` over JSON-RPC before
  running, replacing the REST curl preflight that TrueNAS 26.0
  removed the endpoint for.

### Fixed (rc.4, SCALE 25.10 API drift, 2026-06-09)

- `tunable` create/update/delete became middleware **jobs** in
  25.10; the resource now calls them through the job path and
  polls to terminal state.
- `filesystem.getacl` takes positional args on 25.10 and
  `filesystem.setacl` is a job; both converted.
- `IsNotFound` now recognizes all five not-found surfaces TrueNAS
  emits, including `MatchNotFound()` (carried in the error *reason*
  rather than the message) and job failures re-wrapped as plain
  errors by the job runner. Fixes spurious destroy-time failures
  and the `_disappears` acceptance pattern on live 25.10.

### Changed (rc.4, test rigor)

- 100.0% statement coverage on all internal packages; CI coverage
  gates locked at 100.

### Changed (continued, REST removal, 2026-06-09)

- **REST transport fully retired.** `internal/client/` is gone.
  Every resource and data source flows over JSON-RPC over
  WebSocket via `internal/wsclient/`. The `transport` provider
  attribute, the `TRUENAS_TRANSPORT` env var, and the
  `transport = "rest"` opt-out documented in earlier v2.0
  drafts do not exist in the shipped code. Operators on
  TrueNAS SCALE versions older than 25.04 (when WebSocket
  landed upstream) must stay on the v1.x provider line.

  Why: continuing to ship the dual-transport surface meant
  carrying ~30 kLOC of REST machinery for an opt-out path no
  test suite was exercising. Cutting it now reduces the
  v2.0 attack surface, halves the redactor's coverage burden,
  and matches iX's published SCALE 26.04 REST removal
  timeline.

- **internal/wsclient hardening:** decorrelated jitter on
  `[EBUSY] Rate Limit Exceeded` retries (auth handshake
  retries up to 12 attempts with backoff capped at 6s);
  IsNotFound now accepts the `CodeInvalidParams [ENOENT]`
  variant TrueNAS emits on `*.get_instance` for missing ids
  (Delete is now idempotent across the three not-found
  surfaces).

- **internal/sweep rewritten** to issue inline `http.Get`
  against the TrueNAS REST API for collection-list endpoints
  (the only place a typed wsclient helper isn't worth
  building). Sweepers are dev-time test cleanup; production
  runtime is wsclient-only.

### Tests (continued)

- **Tiered coverage gate** in `scripts/acc.sh`. Tier 1
  packages (`types`, `validators`, `wsclient`, `sweep`,
  `fwresource`, `flex`, `acctest`, `planhelpers`,
  `planmodifiers`, `resourcevalidators`) hold at or near
  100%; Tier 2 packages (`resources`, `datasources`,
  `provider`, `recordreplay`) have explicit floors. The
  resource/datasource layers can't be unit-covered against
  the WS transport without rewriting fixtures to use
  internal/wsclient/testserver.go; the acc suite is the
  canonical coverage source for those layers.

- **Two new static invariants** (provider gate set at 21):
  - `TestConfigureUsesWSClient`, every resource's
    Configure type-asserts `*wsclient.Client` (not
    `*client.Client`)
  - `TestDataSourceConfigureUsesWSClient`, same for
    datasources
  - Block accidental REST regression at the source-text
    level, anyone copying an old resource forward will
    fail the invariant before runtime.

- **23 of 23 stub DataSource acc tests converted** to real
  acc coverage. Pattern: create a fixture resource via the
  provider, query via the datasource, assert attribute
  round-trip. Env-gated cases (catalog, apps, vms,
  network_interface) carry explicit skip messages.

### Breaking, SCALE 25.10 compatibility realignments

- **`truenas_share_smb.purpose` accepts a new vocabulary.** TrueNAS
  25.10 overhauled the SMB share preset registry. The earlier
  vocabulary (ENHANCED_TIMEMACHINE, LEGACY_SMB_WHITELIST,
  MULTI_PROTOCOL_NFS, MULTI_PROTOCOL_AFP, PRIVATE_DATASETS,
  NO_PRESET, TIMEMACHINE) is no longer accepted by the upstream API.
  Only `DEFAULT_SHARE` survives. The new 25.10 vocabulary is:
  - `DEFAULT_SHARE`
  - `LEGACY_SHARE` (closest match for the old `NO_PRESET`)
  - `TIMEMACHINE_SHARE` (replaces both `TIMEMACHINE` and
    `ENHANCED_TIMEMACHINE`; requires `aapl_extensions=true` on
    global SMB config)
  - `MULTIPROTOCOL_SHARE` (replaces `MULTI_PROTOCOL_NFS` /
    `MULTI_PROTOCOL_AFP`)
  - `PRIVATE_DATASETS_SHARE` (replaces `PRIVATE_DATASETS`)
  - `EXTERNAL_SHARE` (new, requires preset-options map; tracked
    as v2.x gap)
  - `TIME_LOCKED_SHARE` (new)
  - `VEEAM_REPOSITORY_SHARE` (new, requires enterprise license)

  Operators upgrading from v1.x with a `purpose` value in state
  must migrate to the closest 25.10 equivalent before the next
  apply.

### Added

- **`truenas_dataset.compression` accepts the full SCALE 25.10
  algorithm ladder.** Earlier versions of the provider only allowed
  16 values (the GZIP 1–9 ladder + plain ZSTD / ZSTD-FAST + the
  legacy LZ4 / LZJB / ZLE / OFF set). 25.10's
  `pool.dataset.compression_choices` actually exposes 49 algorithms
 , every `ZSTD-{1..19}`, every `ZSTD-FAST-{1..10}`, plus the
  skip-step `ZSTD-FAST-{20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,500,1000}`, and
  `ON` (server-side "use pool default"). Provider now accepts all
  49 verbatim; configs that need fine-grained ZSTD level control
  no longer require an apply-time API error to discover.

### Changed

- **WebSocket transport package (`internal/wsclient/`) shipped but
  not yet wired into resource I/O paths.** v2.0 includes the full
  JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket client, call surface, reconnect/replay
  chaos coverage, error matrix, redaction parity with the REST path
 , but `provider.Configure()` currently still instantiates only the
  REST `*client.Client`. Every resource and data source continues to
  flow over REST against `/api/v2.0`.

  Why ship the package without wiring it: v2.0's resource surface
  doesn't need to change shape to swap transports later. The
  wsclient package validates against issue #8 (REST deprecation
  alerts on SCALE 25.04+) and enables a downstream operator to
  build against either transport. The actual provider-level cutover
  is tracked as v2.1 scope so v2.0 ships the test surface + the
  bug fixes without bundling a transport switch into the same
  release.

  **Operator impact:** none. v2.0 behaviour vs v1.x is identical
  on the wire. SCALE 25.10 keeps REST available; SCALE 25.04+
  surfaces a "deprecated REST API was used" alert that operators
  see today and will continue to see until the v2.1 transport
  cutover.

### Fixed

- **`terraform import truenas_cloud_sync.*` no longer errors with
  `cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field`**, TrueNAS returns the
  `credentials` field as a nested object on `GET /cloudsync/id/<n>`
  (and the equivalent JSON-RPC `cloudsync.get_instance`), but as a
  plain integer on create/update responses. The Go struct field was
  always `int`, so import / refresh paths errored out. A custom
  `UnmarshalJSON` on the shared `CloudSync` struct now accepts both
  shapes, plain int (used as-is) and nested object (extracts `.id`).
  Mirrored on both `internal/client.CloudSync` (REST path) and
  `internal/types.CloudSync` (used by the WebSocket transport).
  Originally reported and fixed by Max Poelman in PR #12.

- **Cross-attribute validators no longer reject Unknown values at plan
  time.** Two related bug fixes surfaced by the v2.0 acceptance suite
  on TrueNAS SCALE 25.10:
  - `internal/resourcevalidators.RequiredWhenEqual` treated an Unknown
    required attribute as missing. Configs that wired the required
    value from a sibling resource's computed attribute
    (`path = truenas_dataset.x.mount_point`) failed plan with
    `Missing required attribute`. The validator now defers to apply
    time when the value is Unknown.
  - `truenas_iscsi_extent.ModifyPlan` had the same shape bug for
    `path`, `disk`, and `filesize`. Same fix: defer cross-attribute
    checks to apply time when any input is Unknown.

- **`terraform import truenas_filesystem_acl.<id>` no longer errors
  with `String should have at least 1 character`.** ImportState was
  only seeding `id`; the next Read sent an empty `path` to the
  middleware and TrueNAS rejected it. ImportState now seeds both
  `id` and `path` from the import argument (they carry the same
  filesystem-path string).

### Security

- **Redactor closes three secret-leak paths** surfaced by the v2.0
  brutal-test sweep (property-based redactor tests over every
  schema-`Sensitive` attribute). All three were paths where a real
  secret could reach `APIError.Body`, `tflog` traces, or
  `Diagnostics.AddError` output:
  - **ACME account_key** wasn't in `sensitiveKeyFragments`. The
    `truenas_acme_dns_authenticator` resource has an `account_key`
    attribute whose value is private-key material. Added
    `account_key` to the fragment list on both REST and WebSocket
    redactors.
  - **JSON-in-string values** bypassed the recursive walker. Pattern:
    `"settings_json": "{\"password\":\"…\"}"`, the outer key isn't
    sensitive but the inner JSON contains a secret. `walkRedact` now
    re-parses string values that look JSON-shaped, recursively
    redacts, and re-marshals.
  - **URL basic-auth, `X-API-Key`/`Authorization` headers, raw
    bearer tokens** bypassed the key-fragment matcher in error
    message strings (hyphens vs underscores, no key name at all).
    A new pattern-based pass runs before the fragment matcher and
    replaces the secret portion while preserving the
    scheme/header prefix so operators can still see the leak source.

### Tests

- **178 JSON-unmarshal fuzz targets** added across
  `internal/types`, `internal/client`, and `internal/wsclient`. Each
  target round-trips bytes through Unmarshal → Marshal → Unmarshal
  and must not panic. Seeded with a shared 23-entry corpus of
  well-formed, edge, and malformed JSON. As regression tests they
  run in ~40 ms; under `go test -fuzz=…` they run millions of
  mutations per target. A pre-tag fuzz sweep of the 10 highest-risk
  types ran 42M mutated inputs with zero panics.
- **Property-based invariants over every response struct**:
  `TestProperty_MarshalRoundTripStable` asserts no type silently
  drops data on re-marshal (the bug pattern that caused PR #12);
  `TestProperty_UnmarshalUnknownFieldsTolerated` asserts the
  provider survives TrueNAS adding new attributes in a minor
  version.
- **Brutal redactor tests** enumerate every known schema-`Sensitive`
  attribute and assert the redactor catches each one. These caught
  the three Security fixes above.

### Added

- **`_disappears` acceptance test coverage for every deletable resource**
 , 38 new behavioural acceptance tests in `internal/resources/*_test.go`,
  one per resource that supports out-of-band deletion. Each test creates
  the resource, deletes it via a direct API call (bypassing Terraform),
  and asserts the next plan recognises the drift with
  `ExpectNonEmptyPlan: true`. Pairs with the existing per-resource
  `CheckDestroy` callback to verify both the Terraform-driven destroy
  path and the recovery-from-deletion path. Resources covered include
  the storage family (dataset, zvol, share_nfs, share_smb,
  snapshot_task, scrub_task, replication), identity (user, group,
  api_key, privilege, keychain_credential), tasks and networking
  (cronjob, init_script, static_route, alert_service, tunable),
  certificates and misc (certificate, acme_dns_authenticator,
  kerberos_realm, kerberos_keytab, vm, vm_device,
  filesystem_acl_template, reporting_exporter, cloud_backup, vmware),
  iSCSI (target, portal, initiator, extent, targetextent, auth), and
  NVMe-oF (host, subsys, port, host_subsys, port_subsys).

- **Four new static-analysis invariant tests** in `internal/provider/`
  that scan the Go source as strings to enforce shape-level guarantees
  across every resource:
  - `TestResourcesHaveImportStateImplemented`, every
    `ResourceWithImportState` must use the passthrough helper or carry
    an explicit `// import: custom` opt-out comment.
  - `TestResourcesRemoveFromStateOnNotFound`, every resource's `Read`
    method must call `resp.State.RemoveResource(ctx)` on `IsNotFound`,
    with an allowlist for the 18 singleton-by-design resources where
    delete-is-reset-to-default semantics apply.
  - `TestAcceptanceTestsHavePreCheckOrSkip`, every `TestAcc*` function
    must either call `testAccPreCheck(t)` or contain an explicit
    `t.Skip(...)` stub.
  - `TestAcceptanceTestsHaveCheckDestroy`, every non-`PlanOnly`,
    non-stub acceptance test must wire a real `CheckDestroy` callback.

- **Production-host deny safety rail**, `internal/acctest/acctest.go`
  now refuses to build a client targeting the configured production
  hostname. Three layers of defence: shell-level check in
  `scripts/lib/_env.sh`, Go-level `assertNotProd()` in the test client
  constructor (honours `TRUENAS_PROD_DENY` env override, empty
  disables), and explicit documentation in `scripts/README.md` and
  `.envrc.example` reminding operators to point tests at a non-prod
  TrueNAS only.

- **Local acceptance-test runner**, `scripts/acc.sh` ships a six-stage
  pipeline (preflight, build, lint, unit tests + 100% coverage check,
  static invariants, full acceptance suite) with per-run log files,
  `--skip-acc`, `--acc-only`, and `--resource <name>` flags. Make
  targets `acc`, `acc-skip`, `acc-only`, `acc-preflight`,
  `acc-disappears`, and `acc-resource RESOURCE=<name>` wrap the
  script. Designed for operator-paced runs against a non-production
  TrueNAS instance; no CI dependency.

- **14 `ExpectError` negative-path acceptance tests for validators**
 , `internal/provider/acc_validator_errors_test.go` exercises every
  wired validator with hostile input, asserting plan-time rejection
  before any API call. Covers `IPOrCIDR` (invalid IP, malformed CIDR,
  5-octet "IP", text-host CIDR, IPv6 positive control), four
  `stringvalidator.OneOf` enums (`init_script.type`,
  `init_script.when`, `nvmet_port.addr_trtype`, `iscsi_target.mode`),
  three `int64validator` bounds (`certificate.key_length`,
  `nvmet_port.addr_trsvcid` low/high), and `dns_nameserver.address`
  regex rejection. Locks the `.tf`-layer contract: removing a
  validator or changing an enum without updating callers fails the
  test. Previously the entire tree had one `ExpectError` assertion.

- **Apply-idempotency check rolled out to 5 more resources**, the
  `PostApplyPostRefresh: plancheck.ExpectEmptyPlan()` invariant now
  fires on `static_route`, `group`, `cronjob`, `tunable`, and
  `iscsi_portal` in addition to the prior `dataset`, `share_smb`,
  `user`. Each carries a `PreApply` `ExpectResourceAction`
  `Create` guard on top so a Create-becoming-Update regression also
  fires. `idempotencyCheckMinimum` ratchet bumped from 3 to 8.
  Coverage went from 5.3% to 13.8% of acc test files.

- **Three new static-analysis invariants** in `internal/provider/`:
  - `TestResourcesWithSchemaVersionHaveUpgradeState`, any resource
    that ships `Version: N` (`N > 0`) in its schema must implement
    `ResourceWithUpgradeState` and ship a `*_upgradestate_test.go`.
    Catches the highest-blast-radius mistake a provider author can
    make: schema-version bumps without a state migration, which
    silently corrupt state for existing users on apply.
  - `TestImportStateVerifyIgnoreEntriesAreDocumented`, every
    `ImportStateVerifyIgnore` field across the test tree must appear
    in an explicit `allowedIgnoreFields` registry with one-line
    rationale. Defeats the "just add it to the ignore list to make
    the test pass" anti-pattern that hides real Read/Create shape
    bugs. Current registry: 46 documented entries.
  - `TestSweepersHaveAcctestPrefixGuard`, every `sweep<Name>`
    function in `sweeper_test.go` must either call an Acctest-prefix
    helper (`sweeperHasAcctestPrefix`, `sweeperDatasetIsAcctest`,
    etc.) or carry a `// sweep-no-prefix-guard: <reason>` opt-out
    comment. Defense-in-depth alongside the `TRUENAS_PROD_DENY`
    safety rail.

- **`TestSensitiveFieldsAreMarkedSensitive` invariant**, every
  schema attribute whose name strongly implies a secret value
  (`password`, `secret`, `peersecret`, `api_key`, `privatekey`,
  `dhchap_key`, `dhchap_ctrl_key`, `v3_password`, `v3_privpassphrase`,
  `passphrase`, `client_secret`, etc.) must carry `Sensitive: true`.
  Without that flag, the framework leaks the value into terraform
  plan output, terraform show, and trace logs on every apply -
  a credential-disclosure foot-gun second only to committing the
  secret to git. All 10 current sensitive-named fields pass; the
  invariant locks the contract for every future credential field.

- **Apply-idempotency rollout: 3 → 29 acceptance tests (5.3% → 49.2%)**
 , the `ConfigPlanChecks.PostApplyPostRefresh: ExpectEmptyPlan()`
  assertion is now wired into half the acc test surface, up from
  three pattern-proof resources at the start of the rigor batch.
  Each adopting resource also carries `PreApply: ExpectResourceAction
  Create` so a Create-becoming-Update regression is caught with the
  same step. `idempotencyCheckMinimum` ratchet bumped 3 → 29.
  Rolled out to: static_route, group, cronjob, tunable, iscsi_portal,
  nvmet_subsys, nvmet_port, iscsi_initiator, init_script,
  kerberos_realm, iscsi_target (extended existing PreApply guards),
  iscsi_targetextent, nvmet_host_subsys, nvmet_port_subsys, privilege,
  share_nfs, iscsi_extent, nvmet_namespace, iscsi_auth, nvmet_host,
  api_key, snapshot_task, scrub_task, zvol, certificate, rsync_task.
  Deferred: singletons with server-side defaulting, sensitive-JSON
  resources where the API masks fields on read, beta/env-gated
  resources, and complex computed-field resources (VM, replication).

- **`TestValidatorErrorCoverage` invariant + 22 ExpectError tests**
 , `acc_validator_errors_test.go` exercises every wired validator
  with hostile input, asserting plan-time rejection before any API
  call. Coverage went from 1 to 22 tests. The new ratchet test in
  `validator_error_coverage_test.go` counts the
  `TestAccValidator_*` functions and asserts `>= 22`. Removing one
  would silently drop a plan-time guarantee, so the ratchet makes
  that visible in review.

  Tests cover: `IPOrCIDR` (5), `stringvalidator.OneOf` (4),
  `int64validator.Between` boundaries (5), `stringvalidator.LengthBetween`
  boundaries (3), `stringvalidator.RegexMatches` (1), with at least
  one test per wired validator.

- **`TestAcceptanceLifecycleCoverage` invariant, 62 resources
  lifecycle-locked**, every resource family must have all four
  CRUD phases (`_basic`, `_update`, `_import`, `_disappears`) or
  appear in `lifecycleResourceExclusions` with a per-phase rationale.
  Missing any phase leaves a regression vector that escapes detection
  until a user trips over it.

  Fired one real gap on first run:
  `ACMEDNSAuthenticator` had no import test, fixed by adding an
  `ImportState` test step to `TestAccACMEDNSAuthenticator_basic`
  in the same commit.

  Exclusions are catalogued by category: data sources, singletons
  where `disappears` is a no-op reset, sensitive-payload resources
  where `import` cannot round-trip the secret, env-gated/beta
  resources, and one test-naming alias.

- **Plan-time destroy warning expanded to 15 more destructive
  resources**, `planhelpers.WarnOnDestroy` now fires from
  `ModifyPlan` on: `api_key`, `privilege`, `iscsi_initiator`,
  `iscsi_targetextent`, `nvmet_subsys`, `nvmet_namespace`,
  `nvmet_port`, `keychain_credential`, `acme_dns_authenticator`,
  `kerberos_realm`, `vmware`, `kerberos_keytab`, `vm_device`,
  `nvmet_host_subsys`, `nvmet_port_subsys`. These are the
  "operator removes one line of HCL and loses access to data /
  auth / mounts" failure modes. The warning surfaces destructive
  intent at `terraform plan` time so the operator sees it before
  running `apply`. Complements the client-layer
  `destroy_protection` rail that BLOCKS the wire call.
  `destroyWarnFloor` ratchet 22 → 37.

- **Apply-idempotency check: 100% coverage**, `TestIdempotencyCheckCoverage`
  rewritten from a floor-style ratchet to a 100%-or-excluded contract.
  Every `acc_*_test.go` in `internal/provider/` that ships a managed
  resource Apply step MUST carry
  `ConfigPlanChecks.PostApplyPostRefresh: ExpectEmptyPlan()`, unless
  it appears in `idempotencyExclusions` with a one-line rationale
  (data sources, PlanOnly validator-error tests, import-only tests,
  scaffolding files).

  Coverage went 3/57 → **54/54 (100% of non-excluded)** across 27
  resources rolled out in 8 batches. Singletons, sensitive-payload
  resources, and complex resources (VM, replication) all included.
  Failures at runtime expose real Read/Create shape bugs in the
  provider, the fix goes in the resource code (plan modifier,
  `UseStateForUnknown`, Read implementation), never in the
  exclusion list.

- **Update-plan-shape check: 100% coverage**, new
  `TestUpdatePlanCheckCoverage` asserts every `_update` acc test
  carries `plancheck.ExpectResourceAction(name, ResourceActionUpdate)`
  on its change step, or appears in `updatePlanCheckExclusions` with
  rationale (no-op same-value steps, RequiresReplace changes, data
  sources, gated tests).

  Without this assertion, an `_update` test can pass while silently
  running destroy+create when someone accidentally bumps a Required
  attribute to `RequiresReplace`, the end-state `TestCheck`
  assertions still pass because the value is the same after recreate.
  The plan-shape assertion is what catches the regression at plan
  time. **50/50 non-excluded** acc tests now carry the check; 6
  documented exclusions cover the legitimate edge cases.

### Added (continued, post-rc.2 push)

- **Active Directory full-lifecycle acceptance test** -
  `TestAccDirectoryServices_fullADLifecycle` in
  `internal/resources/directoryservices_test.go` exercises the
  complete kerberos_realm + directoryservices join + leave cycle
  against a live AD DC. Env-gated by `TRUENAS_TEST_AD=1` +
  `TRUENAS_TEST_AD_DC` / `_REALM` / `_ADMIN_PRINCIPAL`. Runs
  against a throwaway Samba AD-DC container.

- **Record/replay HTTP proxy** (`internal/recordreplay/`) for
  live-API-free CI. Recorder mode captures every request/response
  pair to disk indexed by a stable hash; Replayer mode serves
  fixtures back. Lets the acc suite run against a recorded corpus
  instead of a live test TrueNAS. JSON fixture format is portable
  and reviewable, wire-shape regressions show up as diffs.

- **HTTP path chaos suite** (`internal/client/chaos_full_test.go`)
  with 5 e2e scenarios the existing wsclient reconnect/replay
  coverage didn't reach for REST: mid-call TCP RST, TLS cert
  rotation, random 30% connection drops over 20 iterations, slow
  drip body deadline enforcement, repeated reconnect cycles.

- **Scale benchmarks** (`internal/client/scale_bench_test.go`)
  for 1k / 10k / 100k record JSON Unmarshal performance + a
  100 MB heap-delta ceiling test for the 10k path. Regressions
  in the parse pipeline (e.g. an O(n²) walker introduced by a
  future redactor change) surface as benchmark time delta.

- **Multi-version compat runner** -
  `scripts/acc-matrix.sh` discovers `.envrc.local-<version>`
  files and runs the acc suite against each in turn. Per-version
  templates (`.envrc.local-25-04.template`,
  `.envrc.local-26-beta.template`) document the credential
  bootstrap flow.

- **Provider-side fix: directoryservices Read preserves planned
  values on API silent-revert.** TrueNAS' directoryservices.update
  can silently revert kerberos_realm / enable / timeout /
  service_type fields if a join attempt doesn't take. The
  framework treats that as "inconsistent result after apply" and
  aborts. The Read mapping now keeps the operator's planned value
  when the API response disagrees AND the model already carries
  a deliberate non-zero value. Next plan refresh surfaces real
  drift correctly; the spurious join-failed inconsistency no
  longer aborts apply.

- **3 new static invariants** in the provider gate set:
  - `TestCRUDDiscipline_ReadAlwaysWritesState`, every Read must
    call resp.State.Set OR RemoveResource
  - `TestCRUDDiscipline_CreateReadsBackResource`, every Create
    must call resp.State.Set
  - `TestCRUDDiscipline_DeleteHandlesNotFound`, every Delete
    must tolerate the resource already being gone (singletons
    exempted with rationale)
  - `TestDiagnosticFormat_AddErrorSummaries`, every AddError /
    AddAttributeError summary matches one of the canonical
    shapes (Invalid X / Error Verbing X / Could not verb X /
    Unable to verb X / Conflicting / Incomplete / X must Y /
    Configuring X / Missing/Unexpected/Unsupported)

  Provider invariant set now at 17 static gates.

- **Mutation testing harness** (`make mutation`) wires
  go-mutesting against high-leverage packages. Baselines pinned
  in the Makefile target comment. Tooling has a sandboxing bug
  where manually-applied mutants kill tests but go-mutesting
  reports PASS, scores are nominal indicators, not gates.

### Security (continued)

- **History scrub of repo-internal hostnames**, the v2.0 history
  before this push contained references to a specific test/prod
  hostname pair used during development. Filter-repo'd out across
  every commit message + every file. Zero matches in
  `git log --all -p` for the scrubbed patterns. Force-pushed to
  both `origin` and `github` remotes. Authorship metadata on the
  community PR #12 cherry-pick preserved.

### Notes

- v2.0.0-rc.2 tagged at the cleaned-history HEAD. 7-day soak window
  runs to 2026-06-15 16:35 CDT minimum. Multi-version validation
  (25.04 REST fallback + 26-BETA forward compat) is queued to run
  inside the soak window once the test VMs are installed.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Release artifact layout for Terraform Registry**, the v1.10.1 release
  was rejected by the Registry publish API with `missing files in request
  body` for the per-platform SBOM JSON files. Two issues were resolved:
  - Per-platform SPDX SBOMs were listed in `SHA256SUMS` but the Registry
    upload flow only accepts archives + the manifest. SBOMs are now
    generated under a separate goreleaser id (`sbom`) and excluded from
    `SHA256SUMS` via `checksum.ids: [default]`. SBOMs remain attached to
    the GitHub release as standalone downloadable artifacts.
  - The Terraform Registry manifest was uploaded to the GitHub release as
    `terraform-registry-manifest.json` while `SHA256SUMS` referenced it as
    `terraform-provider-truenas_<version>_manifest.json`. The release
    `extra_files` now applies a matching `name_template` so the on-release
    filename matches the checksum entry.

  This is a release-tooling fix only; provider behaviour is unchanged from
  v1.10.1.

### Added

- **FreeBSD release binaries**, goreleaser now builds `freebsd_amd64`
  and `freebsd_arm64` archives, matching the platform set published by
  `cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare`. Total binary count rises
  from 5 to 7 per release.

- **Signed-release verification documentation**, `SECURITY.md` now
  describes the manual `gpg --verify` flow for the GPG-signed
  `SHA256SUMS` file shipped with every release. The signing public key
  is committed at `docs/gpg-public-key.asc` (fingerprint
  `29A6 D319 E411 670F 561E  2B9C EC8F 6B9D 7DB7 49E7`) so users can
  verify release integrity without trusting the Terraform Registry.

### Changed

- **License: MIT → MPL-2.0**, the README has long advertised MPL-2.0
  via the license badge, but the `LICENSE` file shipped MIT text. The
  file is now the canonical Mozilla Public License v2.0, matching the
  badge and aligning with the license used by HashiCorp-maintained
  Terraform providers.

- **Documentation polish**, README installation example now pins
  `version = "~> 1.10"` (was the stale `"~> 0.4"`); contributor docs
  use GitHub-flavoured terminology (pull request) consistently.

- **Test fixtures use RFC 5737 documentation IPs**, addresses in
  `internal/client/*_test.go`, `internal/resources/*_test.go`,
  `internal/provider/acc_*_test.go`, and `internal/validators/*_test.go`
  now use `192.0.2.x` / `198.51.100.x` (the RFC-reserved
  documentation ranges) instead of arbitrary RFC 1918 addresses. Test
  behaviour is unchanged.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- Release pipeline and metadata refresh; no functional changes versus
  v1.10.0. GitHub Actions CI runs lint, race-enabled tests with a 100%
  coverage gate, `govulncheck`, and `tfplugindocs validate`. Goreleaser
  publishes 5 platform binaries (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64,
  minus windows/arm64) plus SBOMs and a GPG-signed `SHA256SUMS`.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **`truenas_system_update` resource**, new singleton resource for
  controlling TrueNAS SCALE update behaviour from Terraform. Manages:
  - `auto_download` (bool, default `false`), the primary "pin" lever.
    When disabled, TrueNAS never stages an update without a conscious
    action. Backed by `/update/set_auto_download`.
  - `train` (string, optional), the active release train (for example
    `TrueNAS-SCALE-Fangtooth`). Validated against the live
    `/update/get_trains` list at apply time. When omitted, the provider
    reads and preserves whatever the system has configured.
  - `current_version`, `available_status`, `available_version` (all
    computed), read-only observability into the live update state,
    surfaced on every Read so the drift guard can detect out-of-band
    UI changes.

  The resource deliberately does **not** execute updates. `terraform
  apply` will never reboot production, update execution remains a
  manual action via the UI, API, or a dedicated Ansible playbook.
  `Delete` is a no-op that only removes the resource from state,
  leaving the last-applied config in effect on the system.

  Ships with 100% statement coverage on `internal/client/system_update.go`
  and `internal/resources/system_update.go`, full docs at
  `docs/resources/system_update.md`, HCL + import examples under
  `examples/resources/truenas_system_update/`, and inclusion in the
  Configure/ImportState/error-branch coverage batches. Verified
  against the TrueNAS SCALE 25.04 OpenAPI spec.

### Changed

- `internal/provider/docs_coverage_test.go` + `acceptance_coverage_test.go`
  floors raised from 62 → 63 alongside the new resource.

No breaking changes. Safe minor upgrade from v1.9.0.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-15

Polish layer on top of v1.8.0: prod-smoke example workspace, Registry
landing-page rewrite in the conventional provider-docs style, tone
cleanup across docs and code comments, and a goreleaser v2 deprecation
fix. No code change; no wire-path behavior change.

### Phase M, tone and style cleanup

- **`docs/index.md`**, rewritten to match the conventional provider
  index style used by hashicorp/tls, digitalocean, cloudflare, and
  integrations/github: simple frontmatter, neutral one-line purpose,
  Example Usage with a minimal HCL block, Authentication section
  with three credential-passing patterns, Safety rails section
  covering `read_only` / `destroy_protection` and the environment-
  variable emergency brake, hand-authored Schema. No stats, no
  feature lists, no marketing language.

- **`README.md`**, opening shortened from a comma-heavy promotional
  paragraph to a single neutral sentence that states WHAT the
  provider is without selling it.

- **Code comments + CHANGELOG**, promotional comparison framing
  removed across the codebase. Comments now describe each invariant
  on its own merits ("battle-hardened" for tested guarantees,
  "standard" for established patterns, "destructive resources" for
  the relevant resource class).

- **`.goreleaser.yml`**, `archives.format: zip` → `archives.formats:
  [zip]` to resolve the goreleaser v2 deprecation warning surfaced
  by tag pipeline 7628. Output is identical; future goreleaser
  releases will eventually remove the scalar form.

### Phase L, prod-smoke example workspace

- **`examples/prod-smoke/`**, a committed, version-controlled copy
  of the phased-rollout smoke test workspace that operators run
  against their production TrueNAS to verify the provider can read
  state without any ability to mutate anything. Contains:

  - `versions.tf`, provider pin matching the `~/.terraformrc`
    dev_override (source `PjSalty/truenas`, binary staged at
    `/tmp/terraform-provider-truenas`).
  - `variables.tf`, `truenas_url`, `truenas_api_key` (sensitive),
    `smoke_dataset_pool`, `smoke_dataset_name`. Validation blocks
    on the URL (HTTPS required) and the API key (length sanity).
  - `provider.tf`, **Phase 1 rail armed**: `read_only = true`
    AND `destroy_protection = true` both set. Phase 1 is a refresh-
    only drift check: the provider can see prod but physically
    cannot mutate it. Comments walk the operator through Phase 2
    (`read_only=false`, destroy rail still armed) and Phase 3
    (brief destroy window with re-arm).
  - `main.tf`, imports ONE existing dataset into state with an
    `import { to = ... id = ... }` block and a matching
    `resource "truenas_dataset" "smoke"` stanza that the provider
    populates from the server during import-read. Zero changes
    expected on `terraform plan`; any drift surfaces exactly what
    the provider's Read path doesn't round-trip cleanly.
  - `RUN.md`, step-by-step runbook including the SOPS decrypt
    command, the env var export sequence, the expected output,
    the Phase 2 / Phase 3 transitions, and the emergency brake
    (`TRUENAS_READ_ONLY=1 TRUENAS_DESTROY_PROTECTION=1` env vars
    that override HCL).

  `terraform validate` against this workspace passes cleanly with
  the v1.8.0 binary staged at `/tmp/terraform-provider-truenas`.
  The workspace is NOT imported into any CI job, it's a manual
  operator tool.

### Phase K, 100% unit-test coverage (CI gate satisfied)

- **Every package at 100.0% statement coverage.** The CI pipeline's
  per-package 100% coverage gate now passes
  against main. Main pipelines from the v1.6.0 tag onward had been
  failing because Phase B–F additions introduced ~25 uncovered
  functions across 6 packages; this release closes every gap.

- **Functions covered**:

  - `internal/client/client.go`, `newRequestID` refactored into a
    testable `newRequestIDFrom(io.Reader)` plus a thin wrapper;
    `APIError.Error`, `Delete`, `DeleteWithBody`,
    `DefaultRetryPolicy` get targeted unit tests.
  - `internal/client/redact.go`, `redactJSONBody` dead-branch
    (re-marshal failure on Go values that came from `json.Unmarshal`)
    removed, walkRedact only emits marshalable types; `redactMessage`
    gains empty-string + fragment-at-start test coverage.
  - `internal/client/job_helper.go`, `waitIfJobResponse` gains the
    non-int sync-response test (object / string / array bodies).
  - `internal/client/client.go doOnce`, transport-error branch
    now exercised via 127.0.0.1:1 refused-connection test.
  - `internal/planhelpers/destroy_warning.go`, `WarnOnDestroy`
    gains the empty-ID fallback branch test.
  - `internal/planmodifiers/pem_equivalent.go`, `PlanModifyString`
    gains the "PEM plan + non-PEM state" branch test (the inverse
    of the pre-existing "non-PEM plan + PEM state" case).
  - `internal/resourcevalidators/required_when_equal.go` -
    `ValidateResource` gains three branch tests:
    unknown-discriminator, GetAttribute-error on discriminator,
    GetAttribute-error on a required attribute (with `continue`
    loop semantics).
  - `internal/resources/*.go`, 15 `ModifyPlan` hooks + 3
    `ConfigValidators` methods covered via a single table-driven
    test file (`phaseF_modifyplan_coverage_test.go`) that uses the
    pre-existing `callModifyPlanDelete` / `schemaOf` helpers. Each
    resource's null-plan + non-null-state call exercises its
    `WarnOnDestroy` body path; each ConfigValidators call
    dereferences the returned list and touches Description /
    MarkdownDescription.

- **No production code behavior change.** The only production
  delta is the `newRequestID` split into `newRequestID` +
  `newRequestIDFrom(io.Reader)` and the deletion of one dead
  branch in `redactJSONBody`. Both are internal to the client
  package and invisible at the wire level.

### Phase J, acceptance test coverage ratchet

- **`internal/provider/acceptance_coverage_test.go`** -
  `TestAcceptanceTestCoverage` (floor = 62). Walks
  `internal/resources/*.go`, identifies every resource file, and
  verifies its sibling `*_test.go` exists AND contains at least
  one `func TestAcc*` declaration. Fails on missing files, empty
  test files, or count below the floor.

- **`internal/resources/cloudsync_credential_test.go`** -
  the final missing acceptance test, closing 61→62 coverage.
  Shallow `PlanOnly + ExpectNonEmptyPlan` test mirroring the
  existing `TestAccCloudSync_schemaValidation` pattern: exercises
  schema compilation, HCL parsing, validators, and plan
  modifiers end-to-end without requiring live TrueNAS or external
  cloud credentials.

- **`make prod-ready`** gate extended to 23 invariants
  (Phase B+C+D+E+F+G+H+I+J).

### Phase I, docs & examples coverage ratchet

- **`internal/provider/docs_coverage_test.go`**, new static-analysis
  test file with two ratchets:

  - **`TestDocsCoverage`**, three-way cross-check between:
    1. Every resource type declared via `ProviderTypeName + "_..."`
       in `internal/resources/*.go`
    2. Every `docs/resources/*.md` registry doc
    3. Every `examples/resources/truenas_*/{resource.tf,import.sh}`
       example directory
    Fails if any resource lacks a doc or example, if any doc/example
    is orphaned (resource removed/renamed), or if the total falls
    below the `docsCoverageFloor = 62` SLO. No network, no
    tfplugindocs, no terraform, pure file-layout check.

  - **`TestDocsNoPlaceholders`**, greps every committed doc and
    example for TODO/FIXME/XXX/PLACEHOLDER/your-value-here markers.
    Fails if any scaffolding leaks into a tagged release.

- **Legacy example dirs removed**, `examples/resources/dataset/`,
  `examples/resources/iscsi/`, `examples/resources/share_nfs/` were
  stale non-prefixed duplicates from the pre-registry naming era.
  Replaced by the current `examples/resources/truenas_<type>/`
  canonical layout that tfplugindocs expects.

- **`templates/guides/`**, added to protect the 7 hand-authored
  prose guides (architecture, backup-strategy, getting-started,
  importing-existing, kubernetes-storage, phased-rollout,
  upgrade-to-v1) from destructive regeneration. `tfplugindocs
  generate` deletes guides with no corresponding template source;
  copying the guides into `templates/guides/` makes them the source
  of truth for regeneration runs.

- **`make docs`**, semantics changed from `generate` (destructive)
  to `validate` (read-only). The hand-authored docs carry custom
  `subcategory:` frontmatter and prose descriptions that
  `tfplugindocs generate` strips; defaulting to validate prevents
  accidental loss during a routine doc lint.

- **`make docs-regen`**, new target, explicitly dangerous, for
  bulk-bootstrap or schema-wide rename scenarios where a full
  regeneration is intentional. Must be followed by a careful
  diff review.

- **`make prod-ready`** gate extended to 22 invariants
  (Phase B+C+D+E+F+G+H+I).

### Phase H, strict static analysis (golangci-lint, 18 linters)

- **`.golangci.yml`** extended from 10 to 18 enabled linters. Added
  correctness and security linters: `bodyclose`, `contextcheck`,
  `copyloopvar`, `errorlint`, `gosec`, `nilerr`, `unconvert`,
  `usestdlibvars`. The existing 10 (`errcheck`, `gocritic`, `godot`,
  `govet`, `ineffassign`, `misspell`, `prealloc`, `staticcheck`,
  `unparam`, `unused`) remain. `gosec` and `usestdlibvars` are
  scoped out of `_test.go` where they dominate with false positives
  (glob-sourced `os.ReadFile`, test-fixture permissions, magic
  HTTP status codes in assertions).

- **Correctness fixes driven by the new linters**:

  - **`bodyclose` in client.go**: refactored `doOnce` to no longer
    return `*http.Response`. `parseRetryAfter` now runs inside
    `doOnce` (while the response is alive and about to be closed)
    and the parsed duration is stamped onto `APIError.retryAfter`
    before return. `doRequest`'s retry loop is simplified: it
    classifies via `errors.As(err, &apiErr)` instead of
    `resp == nil`. Callers receive bytes, never a still-open
    response, bodyclose safety is guaranteed at the caller
    boundary regardless of retry logic.

  - **`nilerr` × 5**: the recurring "TrueNAS API returns either a
    job ID or a sync-completed sentinel" pattern is now centralized
    in a single `client.waitIfJobResponse(ctx, resp, opLabel)`
    helper with a documented dual-response contract and a
    `//nolint:nilerr` annotation in exactly one place. Four
    client-side callers in `app.go`, `certificate.go`, `pool.go`
    now use the helper. The fifth case in
    `resources/cloud_backup.go` (filterJSONByKeys reference-decode
    fallback) is a different intentional pattern and gets its own
    `//nolint:nilerr` with a doc comment.

  - **`errorlint` in redact_wiring_test.go**: removed the custom
    `errorsAs` helper shim (written to avoid importing `errors`)
    and replaced with stdlib `errors.As`, which is the idiomatic
    and type-safe path for unwrapping. Test now imports `errors`.

  - **`contextcheck` in planhelpers/destroy_warning.go**: the
    `WarnOnDestroy` helper was using `context.Background()` inside
    its body instead of threading the caller's ctx through to
    `req.State.GetAttribute`. The function signature now binds
    `ctx context.Context` (was `_ context.Context`) and threads it.

  - **`copyloopvar` × 90**: deleted 90 `tc := tc` shadowing lines
    across 32 test files. Redundant since Go 1.22 (module requires
    1.25.0). A small Python helper (`/tmp/fix-copyloopvar.py`,
    one-off, not committed) refused to touch any line that didn't
    regex-match a `<name> := <name>` self-shadow.

  - **`gocritic` paramTypeCombine**: `RequiredWhenEqual` signature
    tightened from
    `func(discriminator string, trigger string, required []string)`
    to `func(discriminator, trigger string, required []string)`.

  - **`staticcheck` QF1011**: removed a redundant explicit type
    annotation on the compile-time interface assertion for
    `RequiredWhenEqual` in its test file; the constructor already
    declares the return type.

  - **`goimports` × 18**: auto-formatted imports across 18 resource
    files via `golangci-lint fmt`.

- **`make prod-ready`** gate extended to 21 invariants (Phase
  B+C+D+E+F+G+H). The new Phase H gate auto-detects
  `golangci-lint` in `$PATH` or falls back to
  `$(go env GOPATH)/bin/golangci-lint` so a fresh checkout that
  installs the linter via `go install` works out of the box.
  Full gate still <30s wall-clock including the lint run
  (previously <3s without lint; golangci-lint dominates).

### Phase G, secret redaction in error diagnostics

- **`internal/client/redact.go`**, every non-2xx response body is
  now passed through `redactJSONBody` before it lands on
  `APIError.Body`. Sensitive field values are recursively replaced
  with `[REDACTED]` based on a case-insensitive substring match of
  the JSON key against a fragment list covering `password`,
  `privatekey`, `dhchap_key`, `api_key`, `token`, `secret`,
  `auth`, `credential`, `passphrase`, common cloud-API token field
  names, and more. Non-JSON error bodies are truncated at 512 bytes with a
  `[non-JSON error body, truncated]` prefix.

- **`redactMessage`**, the parsed `message` field is scanned for
  any sensitive-key fragment substring; if found, the message is
  truncated before that fragment and a `[REDACTED]` marker appended.
  TrueNAS middlewared occasionally echoes back offending request
  fields in its Pydantic validation output; this catches that.

- **Why this matters**: `APIError.Error()` flows directly into
  `resp.Diagnostics.AddError()` on every single resource CRUD
  path (37 call sites across 10+ resource files). That diagnostic
  ends up in Terraform's plain-text stderr AND in state-file error
  annotations. Without redaction, a 422 carrying a `dhchap_key`
  or `password` echo would leak material into operator shells and
  shared state backends. The fix is applied once at the source -
  zero resource-side code changes required.

- **Invariant tests (9 total)**:
  - `TestIsSensitiveKey`, 21-case substring matcher unit test
  - `TestRedactJSONBody_{FlatObject,NestedObject,Array,NonJSON,NonJSONTruncated,Empty}`
  - `TestRedactMessage`, passthrough + truncation cases
  - `TestAPIErrorBodyNeverLeaksSecrets`, end-to-end APIError round-trip
  - `TestDoOnceRedactsAPIErrorBody`, httptest wiring test that stands up a
    real server returning a sensitive JSON body and asserts both
    `err.Error()` and `APIError.Body` are scrubbed
  - `TestDoOnceRedactsMessageField`, httptest wiring test for the
    parsed-message branch

- **`make prod-ready`** gate extended to 20 invariants (Phase B+C+D+E+F+G).

### Phase F, plan-time destroy warnings

- **`internal/planhelpers.WarnOnDestroy`**, reusable
  resource.ModifyPlan helper that emits a Warning diagnostic at
  plan time whenever a resource is about to be destroyed. The
  warning names the resource type and ID, explains the impact,
  and points at the `destroy_protection` flag for the blocking
  rail. Non-blocking (the safety rail is
  `client.DestroyProtection`, this is the "see before the cliff"
  rail that complements the "brake at the cliff" rail). Matches
  a standard pattern for destructive resources.

- **22 resources** now call `WarnOnDestroy` from their ModifyPlan
  hook: certificate, cloud_backup, cloud_sync, cronjob, dataset,
  group, init_script, iscsi_auth, iscsi_extent, iscsi_portal,
  iscsi_target, nvmet_host, pool, replication, rsync_task,
  scrub_task, share_nfs, share_smb, snapshot_task, user, vm, zvol.
  14 of those had no existing ModifyPlan and got it newly added;
  8 had an existing ModifyPlan (for other validation logic) and
  got `WarnOnDestroy` prepended ahead of their early-return on
  null plan.

- **`TestDestroyWarningCoverage`**, a SLO-style ratchet that
  fails if the count of resources carrying WarnOnDestroy drops
  below 22. Same mechanism as `TestIdempotencyCheckCoverage` and
  `TestConfigValidatorsCoverage`.

- **4 unit tests** for the helper itself:
  `TestWarnOnDestroy_DestroyEmitsWarning`,
  `TestWarnOnDestroy_CreateIsNoOp`,
  `TestWarnOnDestroy_UpdateIsNoOp`,
  `TestWarnOnDestroy_BothNullNoOp`.

- **`make prod-ready`** gate extended to 19 invariants (Phase B+C+D+E+F).
  Still <3s wall-clock, no live infra.

### Phase E, config-time cross-attribute validators

- **`internal/resourcevalidators` package** with the
  `RequiredWhenEqual` helper: when a discriminator attribute
  matches a trigger value, every required companion attribute
  must be set. Runs at config-validation time, before any network
  round-trip. 7 unit tests covering happy path, missing-both,
  missing-one, non-trigger, null discriminator, empty-string,
  and descriptions.

- **ConfigValidators wired onto three resources** with enum
  discriminators:
  - `truenas_certificate`, `create_type=CERTIFICATE_CREATE_IMPORTED`
    requires `certificate` + `privatekey`.
  - `truenas_iscsi_extent`, `type=DISK` requires `disk`,
    `type=FILE` requires `path`.
  - `truenas_network_interface`, `type=LINK_AGGREGATION` requires
    `lag_protocol`, `type=VLAN` requires `vlan_parent_interface`.

- **`TestConfigValidatorsCoverage`** ratchet (floor: 3, bump on
  every new validator).

### Phase D, destroy-protection safety rail ("safe apply" profile)

- **`client.DestroyProtection` + `ErrDestroyProtected`**: a second
  client-layer safety rail that blocks ONLY `DELETE` requests while
  allowing `GET`/`POST`/`PUT` through. Layers beneath `ReadOnly`:
  when both flags are set, `ReadOnly` dominates (strictly broader).
  When only `DestroyProtection` is set, the provider is in "safe
  apply" mode, creates and updates flow, destroys are refused at
  the wire. Matches the per-resource `deletion_protection` pattern
  found in major Terraform providers, except enforced for
  every resource in the provider at once, zero per-resource
  coverage gap.

- **Provider schema `destroy_protection` + env `TRUENAS_DESTROY_PROTECTION`**
  with HCL-precedence-over-env wiring. Defaults to false for
  backwards compatibility. Verbose tflog.Warn on every refused
  DELETE with method/path/req_id for operator correlation.

- **13 new tests**: 6 at client layer (blocks DELETE, allows
  GET/POST/PUT, disabled path, layered with ReadOnly, nil-receiver
  guard, errors.Is wrapping), 4 at provider Configure layer (env
  var table-driven, HCL attribute, HCL-overrides-env, safe-apply
  profile combo). All green in ~5ms total.

- **`make prod-ready`** gate extended to 15 invariants including
  the Phase D tests. Still <3s wall-clock, no live infra.

- **Documentation**:
  - `docs/guides/phased-rollout.md` Phase 3 is now "Safe-apply
    profile: drop read-only, keep destroy-protection" with full
    drill. Phase 3.5 covers intentional destroys with re-arming
    discipline. Emergency brake re-arms BOTH rails.
  - `README.md` has a new "Destroy-protection mode (apply-safe
    rail)" subsection with the production recipe and the
    re-arm pattern.
  - `examples/provider/provider.tf` has a second commented block
    showing the safe-apply profile alongside the read-only profile.

### Added, Phase B battle-hardening for prod rollout

- **Read-only safety rail** (`client.Client.ReadOnly` field + `ErrReadOnly`).
  When enabled, every mutating request (POST/PUT/DELETE) fails before any
  network call is made, the target TrueNAS never sees the attempt, not
  even in access logs. Configurable via `read_only = true` in the provider
  block OR the `TRUENAS_READONLY={1,true}` environment variable. HCL takes
  precedence. Intended use: `terraform plan` against production with the
  rail engaged, flip off only after the plan looks correct.
- **Fault injection tests** at the client layer: malformed JSON,
  wrong-shape responses, empty bodies on typed methods, slow bodies
  (context-deadline honored), connection reset mid-body (retry recovers),
  and raw-socket garbage (transport error surfaces, no panic). 6 tests
  in `internal/client/fault_responses_test.go`.
- **plancheck.ExpectEmptyPlan** on dataset/user/share_smb `_basic`
  acceptance tests. Catches the "terraform plan is never clean" family
  of provider bugs where Read returns values the state doesn't hold.
- **Sweeper coverage invariant** (`TestSweeperCoverage`), every
  resource MUST either be registered with a sweeper or be in the
  `resourceSweeperExclusions` map with a rationale. Closes the silent
  38/62 gap; 24 legitimately excluded (singletons, dangerous, pending)
  with per-entry justification.
- **Apply-idempotency coverage ratchet** (`TestIdempotencyCheckCoverage`)
 , a SLO-style gate that fails if the number of acc tests with
  `PostApplyPostRefresh: ExpectEmptyPlan` drops below the floor.
  Current floor: 3; bump per-rollout.
- **Delete-NotFound invariant** (`TestDeleteHandlesNotFound`), every
  non-singleton resource's Delete MUST call `client.IsNotFound` so a
  delete-while-already-gone race surfaces as a graceful state removal,
  not a fatal Terraform error. 15 singleton exclusions documented.
- **CRUD logging invariant** (`TestCRUDLogging`), every resource's
  Create/Read/Update/Delete MUST emit at least one tflog call inside
  its body. Drive-by refactors can no longer silence the operator.
  Currently 248/248 CRUD methods pass.
- **Typed-CRUD readonly test**, exercises the safety rail through
  `CreateDataset` / `UpdateDataset` / `DeleteDataset` / `GetDataset`
  to prove no typed wrapper swallows `ErrReadOnly` on the way up.

### Live validation

- **Full `TF_ACC=1` acceptance run against TrueNAS SCALE 25.10.0**
  (test VM test VM): **149 PASS / 0 FAIL / 6 SKIP** across
  the 62-resource surface, wall-clock 866s. The 6 skips are
  deliberate: `KMIPConfig_update` (needs external KMIP server),
  `NetworkInterface_basic`/`_update` (writes can disconnect the
  cluster), `PoolResource_disappears` / `SystemDataset_disappears`
  (dangerous), and `CertificateResource_update` (known limitation,
  see below). Two fixture bugs were found and fixed during the run
  (`NVMetHost_update` missing `dhchap_hash`; `Certificate_update`
  PEM-normalization drift).

### Phase C, plan-modifier hygiene gaps closed

- **PEM semantic-equality plan modifier** (`internal/planmodifiers.PEMEquivalent`).
  Decodes every PEM block in plan and state values, re-encodes them
  through `encoding/pem`, and treats the two values as equal when
  their canonical forms match, even when the server has re-wrapped
  base64 lines, swapped CRLF for LF, or stripped trailing whitespace.
  Wired into `truenas_certificate.certificate` and `privatekey` so
  an in-place rename no longer tries to destroy+create on cosmetic
  normalization. Un-skips `TestAccCertificateResource_update`.

- **111 Optional+Computed attributes now carry `UseStateForUnknown()`**.
  Before this release, omitting any such attribute from HCL on a
  subsequent apply caused the Plugin Framework to mark the plan
  value as Unknown ("known after apply"), which showed up as a
  phantom diff on every plan, and for the 6 attributes that ALSO
  had `RequiresReplace()`, it falsely forced destroy+create cycles.
  One of those six (`truenas_certificate.key_type`) was the actual
  root cause of the v1.0 `TestAccCertificateResource_update`
  failure. Mass-fixed across 34 resource files: acme_dns,
  app, certificate, cloud_sync, cronjob, dataset, directoryservices,
  dns_nameserver, group, init_script, iscsi_{extent,initiator,portal,target},
  mail_config, network_{config,interface}, nfs_config,
  nvmet_{global,host,namespace,port,subsys}, pool, replication,
  rsync_task, share_{nfs,smb}, snmp_config, ups_config, user,
  vm, vm_device, zvol.

- **Two new static invariants** in `internal/provider/` block
  regressions on the above:
  - `TestRequiresReplaceRespectsUseStateForUnknown`, every
    Optional+Computed+RequiresReplace attribute MUST carry
    `UseStateForUnknown()` BEFORE `RequiresReplace()` in its
    plan-modifier slice, or the test fails with a file:attribute
    punch list.
  - `TestOptionalComputedHasUseStateForUnknown`, every
    Optional+Computed attribute without a `Default:` MUST carry
    `UseStateForUnknown()` or be in the small exclusion map
    (with a rationale). Catches the broader phantom-diff family.

- **HTTP request-ID correlation at the client layer**
  (`client.newRequestID` + `X-Request-ID` header). Every logical
  API call is tagged with a 16-char lowercase hex ID generated
  from `crypto/rand`; that ID is set on the outgoing header and
  threaded through every `tflog` breadcrumb for the call. Retries
  of the same logical operation share one ID so operators can
  correlate client-side traces with TrueNAS middlewared audit
  entries without the retry storm fragmenting the investigation.
  Covered by `TestNewRequestID_ShapeAndUniqueness`,
  `TestDoRequest_EmitsXRequestIDHeader`, and
  `TestDoRequest_RetriesShareRequestID`.

- **Phase B+C gate**: `make prod-ready` now runs the two plan-modifier
  invariants, the three request-ID tests, and the 11-test PEM
  semantic-equality suite in addition to the existing Phase B
  battle-hardening checks. Still <3s wall-clock, no live infra.

### Known limitations

- None at this release. The v1.1.0-rc `truenas_certificate`
  in-place rename gap was closed by the PEM semantic-equality
  plan modifier above, and `TestAccCertificateResource_update`
  passes in the live TF_ACC run.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added, comprehensive coverage release

- **12 packages × 100.0% literal statement coverage**, race-clean:
  `main`, `cmd/skaff`, `internal/acctest`, `internal/client`,
  `internal/datasources`, `internal/flex`, `internal/fwresource`,
  `internal/planmodifiers`, `internal/provider`, `internal/resources`,
  `internal/sweep`, `internal/validators`. CI enforces this as a gate.
- **Hard fuzz regression**: 8 fuzz targets × 30s each = 52,486,918
  executions, zero crashes. Corpus persistence under `testdata/fuzz/`.
- **8 benchmarks** covering hot paths (doRequest, backoffDelay,
  4× mapResponseToModel, 2× validators).
- **Integration tests** via `resource.UnitTest` with a `mockTrueNAS`
  httptest backend, run under plain `go test`, no TF_ACC required.
- **PlanCheck assertions** in 5 representative acceptance tests
  (Create/Update actions, known values, Update-not-Replace guards).
- **tflog.Trace instrumentation**: 985 entry/exit calls across all
  resource CRUD handlers and client methods.
- **8 new data sources** (now 33 total): iscsi_target, iscsi_portal,
  iscsi_extent, iscsi_initiator, api_key, keychain_credential,
  snapshot_task, alert_service.
- **7 resources with ResourceWithModifyPlan** for cross-attribute
  validation at plan time (nvmet_host, vm, iscsi_extent, share_nfs,
  certificate, replication, iscsi_target).
- **truenas_cronjob seeds the SchemaVersion: 1 + StateUpgrader**
  pattern for future schema migrations.
- **3 new plan modifiers**: RequiresReplaceIfChangedInt64,
  RequiresReplaceIfChangedBool, JSONEquivalent.
- **4 new helper packages**: internal/flex,
  internal/acctest, internal/fwresource, internal/sweep.
- **cmd/skaff**: resource scaffolding tool with 16 unit
  tests and 100% coverage.
- **Release pipeline**: goreleaser v2 expanded to 14 platform targets
  (up from 6), SBOM via syft, GPG signing stanza, registry manifest.
- **Binary-level E2E verified**: released artifact installed via
  dev_overrides, terraform validate + plan succeed for 10 resource
  types.
- **Community infrastructure**: SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md,
  CODEOWNERS, issue/PR templates, pre-commit hooks, renovate,
  .changelog/ + changie, markdownlint, yamllint.
- **Expanded CONTRIBUTING.md** (~200 lines) with industry-standard
  workflow, resource addition checklist (incl. skaff), quality gates
  table.
- **New docs/guides**: architecture.md, upgrade-to-v1.md.
- **Coverage gate in CI** fails any drop below 100.0%.
- **test:fuzz CI job**: manual 30s-per-target smoke run.

### Fixed

- `google.golang.org/grpc` bumped v1.79.2 → v1.79.3 (fixes
  GO-2026-4762, authorization bypass via missing leading slash in
  `:path`).

### Security

- Sensitivity audit: `Sensitive: true` added to
  `reporting_exporter.attributes_json` and `vm_device.attributes`;
  18 existing credential fields verified.

---

## Prior entries, rolled into 1.0.0

- **MILESTONE: Full acceptance test suite 100% green against
  TrueNAS SCALE 25.10.0.** Final run: 151 passing + 5 intentional skips
  = 156/156, 0 failures. Skipped tests are legitimate exceptions: KMIP
  update (requires real KMIP server), network_interface basic+update
  (env-gated for safety on shared VM), pool disappears (can't destroy
  the test pool), systemdataset disappears (singleton). 2 resources
  graduated from Beta to GA based on live verification:
  `truenas_cloudsync_credential` and `truenas_kerberos_keytab`. Remaining
  7 Alpha/Beta resources are gated on infrastructure the acceptance test
  environment lacks (real DNS provider for ACME, real KDC for directory
  services, external cloud credentials, Fibre Channel for vmware).
- **Live TF_ACC run against TrueNAS SCALE 25.10.0 test VM** (test VM -
  separate from production). First cold run: 133/152 pass (87.5%). Surfaced
  and fixed several real provider bugs:
  - `truenas_dataset.comments` and `truenas_zvol.comments` now use
    `dataset.GetComments()` which transparently handles SCALE 25.10's move
    of `comments` from top-level to `user_properties.comments` (top-level
    is always null in 25.10, breaking round-trip on every dataset).
  - `truenas_certificate.disappears`: cert delete on an already-gone cert
    returns `[ENOENT] Certificate N does not exist` from the long-running
    job rather than an HTTP 404. The client `DeleteCertificate` helper now
    normalizes that to a `404` `*APIError` so resource Delete handlers can
    use `client.IsNotFound` to treat it as success.
  - `truenas_catalog.sync_on_create` now has a `booldefault.StaticBool(false)`
    so the field is always Known after Update (Terraform was rejecting plans
    with "Provider returned invalid result object after apply").
  - `truenas_vm.bootloader_ovmf` and `enable_secure_boot` are no longer
    sent in `vm.update` requests, SCALE 25.10 rejects them with HTTP 422
    "Extra inputs are not permitted". They remain Computed-readable but are
    create-time-only.
- **Unit tests expanded to 1799 passing** (up from 1079): datasource package
  gains a full httptest-based harness (`testutil_test.go`) that builds a real
  `*client.Client`, configures it with a mocked server, and invokes
  `datasource.Read` through a `tfsdk.Config` wire, exercising the full
  config-decode → client-call → state-set path. Every data source gets a schema
  test plus success/404/500/invalid-JSON/empty-list/lookup-by-name coverage.
  Resource package gains batch `Schema`/`Metadata`/`Configure`/`ImportState`
  tests plus `mapResponseToModel` fixture cases for 50+ resources and CRUD
  roundtrip tests for 8 singleton configs + 12 ID-based resources against an
  `httptest.Server`-backed client. **Package coverage: datasources 1.7% →
  73.3%, resources 7.9% → 35.8%, overall 22.5% → 48.8%.**
- **HCL validation test suite** in `internal/provider/examples_validation_test.go`
  parses every `examples/resources/truenas_*/resource.tf` via
  `github.com/hashicorp/hcl/v2/hclparse` to catch broken example syntax before
  release. Also verifies every registered resource has both a doc page
  (`docs/resources/<name>.md`) and an example directory, guarding against
  resource additions that forget to update docs.
- **goreleaser snapshot build verified offline**, `goreleaser release
  --snapshot --clean --skip=publish --skip=sign` produces signed archives for
  linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64,
  windows/arm64 in 32s. All 6 binaries ~7MB trimpath/stripped. SHA256SUMS file
  generated.
- **Sweeper functions for 38 resources** via `internal/provider/sweeper_test.go`
  using `resource.AddTestSweepers`. Run with
  `go test -v ./internal/provider/ -sweep=all` to clean up abandoned acceptance
  test fixtures. Sweepers use an `acct`/`acctest`/`tf-acc` prefix filter so they
  only touch test-managed resources, and encode parent/child ordering via
  `Sweeper.Dependencies` so leaf resources (join tables, namespaces, shares)
  are swept before their parents (datasets, vms, subsystems).
- **Hand-written docs + examples for all 62 resources.** `docs/resources/*.md`
  follows the standard Terraform Registry format (frontmatter + intro +
  Example Usage + Argument Reference + Attribute Reference + Timeouts +
  Import). Each attribute
  is documented with Required/Optional status, valid values (from schema
  validators), defaults, and `RequiresReplace` notes. `tfplugindocs validate`
  passes. Every resource has a runnable `examples/resources/truenas_<name>/`
  directory with `resource.tf` + `import.sh`.
- **~386 new attribute validators across 36 resources**: regex format
  validators (POSIX usernames, dataset names, iSCSI IQNs, SMB share names,
  octal umasks, hex OUIs, `/mnt/` dataset paths); `OneOf` enum validators for
  VM cpu_mode, certificate key_type/key_length, service names, alert providers,
  iSCSI rpm/blocksize, dataset recordsize, NVMe-oF dhchap_hash, SSH log
  levels/facilities, SMB unixcharset; int range bounds on UIDs/GIDs, VM
  cores/threads/memory, certificate lifetime, snapshot lifetime, scrub
  threshold, FTP clients/timeouts, NVMe-oF queues/inline_data; length bounds on
  ~80 string attributes; `validators.IPOrCIDR()` on network_interface aliases,
  iscsi_portal listen.ip, static_route destination/gateway, network_config
  gateways.
- **Per-resource timeout documentation** for long-running resources: vm (20m),
  certificate (20m ACME/CSR), pool (60m), systemdataset (20m), app (30m image
  pulls), replication (30m initial sync). Default `timeouts.Block` confirmed on
  all 62 resources.
- **filesystem_acl 404 handling**: Read and Delete handlers now use
  `client.IsNotFound(err)` to gracefully handle the case where the target
  filesystem path no longer exists, matching the pattern used by the other 45
  resources in the provider.
- **Acceptance test suite expanded from 30 → 156 functions across 58 files**
  (`_basic` + `_disappears` + `_update` triad for every CRUD
  resource, `_basic` + `_update` for singleton configs). The `_disappears`
  pattern calls the TrueNAS API directly via a test-only `testAccClient()`
  helper to out-of-band delete the resource, then asserts
  `ExpectNonEmptyPlan: true` so the provider is verified to detect and
  recover from external drift, the standard Terraform import-and-refresh
  pattern. All acceptance tests still gated on `TF_ACC=1` and run against
  the test VM only.
- **Test suite expanded from 221 → 1079 passing unit tests** (all automated via
  CI `go test -race -coverprofile`). Adds comprehensive httptest-mocked
  CRUD coverage for 42 client files (happy path, 404 → `IsNotFound`, 422/500 →
  `APIError`, invalid JSON, request-body marshaling, URL escaping, job-polling
  paths for async endpoints like certificate / systemdataset / app). Adds
  resource-layer `mapResponseToModel` fixture tests + schema validation tests
  across 30 resources. **Client package coverage: 87.8%**; validators 77.4%;
  plan modifiers 77.8%. All tests pass with `-race`.
- Dataset resource: fix `share_type` drift where SCALE 25.10 returns "GENERIC"
  on read regardless of create-time preset. `share_type` is now treated as a
  create-time preset and user intent is preserved across reads.
- Zvol resource: populate `volsize` and `volblocksize` on read by adding
  `DatasetResponse.Volsize` / `Volblocksize` fields and corresponding
  `GetVolsize()` / `GetVolblocksize()` helpers. Fixes post-import drift where
  both attributes appeared empty.
- Acceptance test fixes: real ed25519 keypair for `truenas_keychain_credential`
  (libcrypto rejects all-zero synthetic keys), `crypto/rand` UUID generator
  for `truenas_nvmet_host` NQN format, GRAPHITE-only attributes for
  `truenas_reporting_exporter`, `group_create` added to
  `ImportStateVerifyIgnore` on `truenas_user`.
- New `truenas_cloudsync_credential` resource + data source managing the
  `/cloudsync/credentials` API. Supports 16 provider types (S3, B2,
  Azure Blob, GCS, Dropbox, FTP, SFTP, HTTP, Mega, OpenStack Swift,
  pCloud, WebDAV, Yandex, OneDrive, Google Drive, Backblaze B2). Unblocks
  fully-Terraform `truenas_cloud_sync` / `truenas_cloud_backup` workflows.
- Provider-level `insecure_skip_verify` attribute and
  `TRUENAS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` environment variable for self-signed
  test environments.
- `client.IsNotFound(err)` helper that unwraps `*APIError` via
  `errors.As` and detects both HTTP 404 and TrueNAS 422
  "does not exist" responses. Applied to 44 resource Delete handlers so
  `terraform destroy` no longer fails when a resource has been removed
  out-of-band.
- Acceptance test scaffold (`internal/provider/provider_test.go`) with
  `testAccPreCheck` and a minimal `TestAccProvider_Schema` case under
  `TF_ACC=1`.
- Repo polish: `.golangci.yml` (13 linters, zero findings), `Makefile`
  with standard HashiCorp targets, `.editorconfig`, and new CI
  jobs for `golangci-lint`, `govulncheck`, `gitleaks`, and
  `tfplugindocs validate`.

### Fixed

- **SCALE 25.10 compatibility**: `iscsi_portal` no longer sends `port`
  in listen entries on create/update, the TrueNAS 25.10 API rejects it
  as "Extra inputs are not permitted". The field is now Computed-only
  and marked deprecated.
- `iscsi_extent`: `path` and `disk` are now `Computed: true` so DISK-type
  extents no longer trigger "Provider produced inconsistent result
  after apply" errors.
- `filesystem_acl`: validator now accepts NFS4 ACL tags (`owner@`,
  `group@`, `everyone@`) alongside the POSIX1E tags.
- `system_info` data source: `uptime_seconds` decoded as `float64`
  (SCALE 25.10 returns a float, not an int).
- `truenas_app`: `version = "latest"` no longer drifts to the resolved
  concrete version in state; the concrete value is exposed via
  `human_version`.
- 44 resource Read handlers: replaced broken `err.(*client.APIError)`
  type assertions (which silently failed on wrapped errors) with
  `client.IsNotFound(err)`.
- Lint cleanup across the codebase: 9 misspellings, 1 regex
  simplification, 4 unused `ctx` parameters, 1 empty branch, 2
  unchecked `fmt.Sscanf` return values, and 36 goimports adjustments.
- Consolidated conflicting `tools.go` at repo root into the canonical
  `tools/tools.go`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- 25 new resources: `vm`, `vm_device`, `app`, `catalog`, `privilege`,
  `kerberos_realm`, `kerberos_keytab`, `directoryservices`, `pool`,
  `network_interface`, `systemdataset`, `nvmet_global`, `nvmet_host`,
  `nvmet_subsys`, `nvmet_port`, `nvmet_namespace`, `nvmet_host_subsys`,
  `nvmet_port_subsys`, `vmware`, `cloud_backup`, `reporting_exporter`,
  `iscsi_auth`, `kmip_config`, `alertclasses`, `filesystem_acl_template`.
- 15 new data sources: `vm`, `vms`, `privilege`, `kerberos_realm`, `app`,
  `apps`, `catalog`, `directoryservices`, `systemdataset`,
  `network_interface`, `share_nfs`, `share_smb`, `cronjob`, `datasets`,
  `pools`.
- Field validators across all 61 resources (range, regex, enum,
  length).
- HTTP client retry/backoff with exponential jitter (max 5 attempts) and
  honoring of the `Retry-After` header on 429/503 responses.
- Per-resource `timeouts` block (create/read/update/delete).
- Generated documentation via `terraform-plugin-docs`.
- Runnable examples per resource in `examples/`.

### Fixed

- `filesystem_acl_template`: strip server-added `who: null` fields so
  round-trips match the user plan.
- `reporting_exporter`, `cloud_backup`: preserve only the user-supplied
  attributes subset; server-side defaults no longer trigger spurious drift.
- `vm_device`: filter server-added attribute keys (e.g. DISPLAY's
  `web_port`) to match the plan.
- `alert_service`: on SCALE 25.10, `type` is now embedded inside
  `attributes` (polymorphic discriminator schema); the top-level `type`
  field introduced in 25.04 has been reverted.
- `dataset`: read `comments` from `user_properties.comments` on SCALE
  25.10 (top-level `comments` field is now always null).

### Changed

- Split `internal/client/client.go` into per-domain files for
  maintainability. `client.go` now contains only the base HTTP client,
  retry/backoff helpers, `APIError`, `Job`/`WaitForJob`, and shared
  common types (`PropertyValue`, `PropertyRawVal`, `Schedule`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- 36 resources + 9 data sources covering the initial expansion wave:
  iSCSI target/portal/extent/initiator/target-extent, CronJob,
  AlertService, Replication, Zvol, User, Group, Tunable, CloudSync,
  RsyncTask, StaticRoute, NetworkConfiguration, InitScript, ScrubTask,
  FilesystemACL, Service, FTP/NFS/SMB/SNMP/SSH/UPS/Mail configs,
  ACME DNS authenticator, API key, Certificate, Keychain credential.
- Per-domain client files co-located with their resource definitions.
- Round-trip test coverage for every resource's Create→Read path.

### Fixed

- `dataset` now round-trips `comments`, `quota`, `refquota`, `sync`,
  `snapdir`, `copies`, `readonly`, and `recordsize` via the
  `PropertyValue`/`PropertyRawVal` indirection the SCALE API uses.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Initial provider implementation supporting TrueNAS SCALE 24.04+.
- API key authentication via `api_key` argument or `TRUENAS_API_KEY`
  environment variable.
- Base URL configuration via `url` argument or `TRUENAS_URL` environment
  variable.
- Built on `terraform-plugin-framework` v1.15.0.
- Initial resources: `dataset`, `share_nfs`, `share_smb`, `snapshot_task`,
  `replication`, `iscsi_portal`, `iscsi_initiator`, `iscsi_extent`,
  `iscsi_target`, `cronjob`, `alert_service`.
- Initial data sources: `dataset`, `pool`, `system_info`.
